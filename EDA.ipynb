When I look back on classes I’ve taken, everything just feels like a fever dream. My notes are just a bunch of equations with zero context. Every time I try to learn a new concept, there’s always a couple very niche calculus proofs you need to do or some other background information which a whole other class could be dedicated to, but it’s all just glossed over. \n",

I’m glad we went over how to solve the time independent Schrödinger equation for a free particle, but what the actual hell do I need this for and in what context is this happening in besides very specific circumstances in a lab? Nothing I have learned seems practical, and if it is practical then the department is very good at keeping that information secret. I’m glad I know how to analyze a dielectric inside an electric field, but to be honest if you were to ask me if a material is a dialectic or not I’d be fucking stumped. And if you were to ask me how to create an electric field in real life I’d tell you that I have no idea. Theoretically you move the electrons but HOW and WHY. When would I ever be calculating an electrical field in my life? What possible job would make me pull out my calculator for this? I’m sure there is one, but no one has bothered to inform me of it in my class.\n",

Everything just seems like a bunch of equations which popped out of thin air that I have to apply calculus to in order to solve, I have no context for anything that I’m doing. I literally need a class just to go over every single equation given to me in the past two years that would explain its derivation and what REAL LIFE context you would ever need to know this for. \n",

You can see how these things combined can make the class a bit of a struggle for students that take it without math or coding experience. **1 hour a week is not enough time to learn a language** you SHOULD assume is new to students! \n",
      "\n",
      "Leading to my second gripe: **an imbalance in group work**:\n",
      "\n",
      "To counteract this lack of time, students are asked to put themselves into groups of 5 to work together on the projects, but when some students have coding experience and some do not, this creates a discrepancy where the students with experience have to choose between teaching their peers (which should not be their responsibility) and finishing the lab quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What confuses me even more is that the TA that I was in contact with told me that having all the students learn R was not the goal, and that \"the more students with more coding experience were expected to carry their peers.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This goal makes even less sense as we begin to be asked to put the names of the people who worked on the project on the lab, and add percentages of group work distribution on our final project. These submissions aren't even anonymous. **Why breed unnecessary conflict??**\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals that the TA and professor express aren't aligned with reasons to incorporate group work. If there were some prerequisites in math and coding added to the course, students would be able to know what they're getting themselves into.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this doesn't mean that I didn't have a poor learning experience. In fact, it was greatly education for me to complete **every** lab assignment, as I was able to practice my proficiency in the language and prepare myself for the final project. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I think that this class was a great learning experience for me. I hope this warning goes out to the students taking the class as though it is on an interesting topic, you have to be prepared for the workload (if you get unlucky, but what are the chances).\n"

      ">**METRO Serves Rising Transit Demand at UCSC with Additional Extra Long Buses**  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">METRO has secured a fleet of 12 extra-long, articulated buses to meet surging transit demand at the UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus. There are currently four, 60-foot articulated buses serving the campus with six more expected to be put into service by the end of 2023 and two in reserve.   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">UCSC riders constitute almost 70% of METRO’s total ridership systemwide. At the start of the 2023 fall term, METRO carried an average of 13,409 UCSC riders per day. This compares to 10,349 average daily UCSC riders in September 2022, a leap of almost 30%.   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">To address the rising demand on campus, METRO struck an agreement with the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) to purchase ten 60-foot articulated buses to augment the two METRO-owned articulated buses already serving the campus. Two of the ten MTS buses were put into service during the second week of the school year with another three more expected to arrive and begin serving the campus within the next two weeks. METRO expects to receive a total of ten articulated buses from MTS by the end of 2023.   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">“UCSC students, faculty, and staff are our largest population of riders and we appreciate their commitment to environmentally friendly transportation,” said METRO Board Chair, Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson “That’s why it was so important for METRO to act quickly to secure more fleet capacity and ensure everyone who wants to ride the bus has a chance to do so.”   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">An articulated bus can accommodate 60-65 seated passengers with room for an additional 15-25 standing passengers while a traditional 40-foot bus can carry 36 seated passengers with an additional 10-15 standees, depending on the make and model of the bus.   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">METRO’s articulated buses will be wrapped with iconic images of Monterey Bay wildlife, such as sea lions, kelp forests, and sea jellies, as part of METRO’s One Ride at a Time campaign (ORAT). ORAT is a key element of METRO’s efforts to be an environmentally focused community partner in Santa Cruz County. ORAT gives riders the opportunity to protect the Monterey Bay’s extraordinary natural resources just by simply riding the bus. Thanks to ORAT, every ride on a METRO bus contributes to our partners in protecting the environment, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Foundation and the Bay of Life Fund.   \n",

      "4. Getting ahead of your peers in the same school year gives you better priority than them. Usually, students in the same year go for the same classes, this will give you a better pick than them and a higher likely hood getting into these interesting classes with good professors.\n",
      "5. If you are able to obtain senior standing ahead of being senior not only do you have the priority of a senior when picking classes (which is the highest without doing a special program like sports or an honors group), but you also can choose 3 classes in your first pass instead of 2!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Taking four classes takes up more of your weekly time to join clubs, hang out with and make new friends, go to parties, do other extracurriculars, have personal time, etc.\n",
      "2. Taking four classes might be too hard for you if you are already finding it hard to do three. Everyone learns at their own pace, and it's possible that three classes are already hitting that sweet spot for you where if you take any more it'll be too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caveat: Of course, this depends on your classes. Some are harder/easier than others, and I would suggest strategizing by looking at your department's tentative class schedule for the school year to plan ahead and your courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking 4 classes in your Freshman and Sophomore year doing your Under-Divs can have very significant benefits. However, you still may find it unfavorable depending on how much you value its Pros vs. its Cons. It's definitely totally valid to not take 4 classes per quarter for your under-divs, but it can be an enticing option if you feel like your current course load of 3 a quarter is an easy-moderate difficulty that I would suggest you consider.\n",

      "First of all, they were in the middle of a 4 year contract that their union voted on and ratified, and their strike was not sanctioned by their union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, they were paid $2,434 monthly for their part time/ 20 hour a week Teaching Assistant positions (about $30 per hour). They wanted an increase of $1,412 monthly. That is a 58% increase, pretty pie in the sky for any job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, they were getting their tuition and healthcare paid for, also a signing bonus, and UCSC offered an additional $2,500 during the strike. Taken together, this is about 30-40k of additional compensation they were receiving. They also, of course, would get a degree out of it. So conservatively, they were earning about $50,000 per year for their 20 hour a week teaching jobs while getting a degree. Keep in mind that their jobs and classes were only 9 month out the year as well, so they had an additional 3 months to earn other income from other jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, many graduate programs in other professions require you to pay for your tuition and health insurance. Ask any lawyer, physician, RN, pharmacist, social worker, MBA, physical therapist, CPA, architect to name a few. Many graduate studies require people to work part time or full time jobs and in most of these programs students generally go into debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, the undergraduate students who paid to be at UCSC were unable to get their grades for months. To make it even worse, strikes included actually disturbing students while taking midterms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot comprehend how anyone could think it was worth it to loose all of their compensation and their graduate degree over roughly $12,000 per year (their requested increase). My bet is most will regret their decision to loose their degree over a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, I am not saying they don't have the right to strike. They can strike, fight for whatever they want, no matter how unreasonable. I am just saying this seems like poor decision making, and now that they are out of their jobs, they are going to have a hard time finding anything even remotely as well paying, not to mention the lost future earnings of not earning their degree.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. So what if it is voluntary? Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? \n",
      "\n",
      "3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "You also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA.\n"

I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm.

Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n",

      "Arguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n",
      "\n",
      "This is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. \n",

      "While I agree with the sentiment that \"We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life\", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that.

      "Too long text on 3092, 1. This is patently false, it is a norm to receive financial support for a PhD program. It is also ridiculous to charge tuition to fourth and fifth year students who don't take any classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. So what if it is voluntary? Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? \n",
      "\n",
      "3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "You also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA.\n"

      "  ur scrutiny of the UCSC chicken mascot in the context of gender stereotypes and its potential role in perpetuating patriarchal ideals is quite thought-provoking. Let's unpack this complex issue:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  scots and Symbolism: Mascots often carry deep symbolic meanings, embodying the spirit, values, and ethos of their institutions. The choice of a chicken as a mascot for UCSC, therefore, isn't just a whimsical decision; it's imbued with cultural and social significance. When analyzing mascots through the lens of gender norms, it's crucial to understand the layers of symbolism they carry and how these symbols are perceived and interpreted by different groups.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  nder Stereotypes and Animal Mascots: The link between gender stereotypes and animal mascots can be subtle yet pervasive. If the chicken mascot exhibits traits or is portrayed in a manner that aligns with traditional gender roles or stereotypes, it could inadvertently reinforce outdated norms. This is particularly problematic if these portrayals are not critically examined or challenged, thereby normalizing certain expectations about gender roles.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  scots as Tools for Social Commentary: Mascots can also serve as tools for social commentary, either reinforcing or challenging societal norms. If the UCSC chicken mascot is used in a way that promotes patriarchal ideals, intentionally or not, it becomes a vehicle for perpetuating those norms. However, this also means that mascots have the potential to be reimagined or reinterpreted to challenge and subvert these norms, offering opportunities for progressive social change.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  ppressing Dissent: Your notion of \"eggsecution\" as a form of suppression of dissent is an intriguing metaphor. In any institution, mascots can become symbols of conformity. If dissenting voices are marginalized or ridiculed using the mascot as a tool or symbol, this raises serious concerns about freedom of expression and the health of the academic community. The role of mascots should be to unite, not to intimidate or suppress.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  -evaluating Mascot Representation: It's important for institutions like UCSC to continuously re-evaluate their symbols, including mascots, to ensure they align with current values and ideals. This includes an assessment of how these symbols are perceived and whether they inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes or practices. Engaging with diverse community voices in this evaluation process is crucial for a holistic understanding.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Moving Forward: Finally, addressing these concerns requires a multi-faceted approach. This includes open dialogues within the UCSC community about the mascot's role and impact, educational initiatives to raise awareness about gender stereotypes, and possibly reimagining the mascot's portrayal to align with inclusive and progressive values. Such steps can transform the mascot from a symbol of contention into one of positive change and unity.\n"

You will also have better self repairability and compatibility, as most name-brand motors (Bosch, Shimano STEPS, etc) are locked down and not easy to fix. I only recommend mid-drive motor kits due to the hilly Santa Cruz terrain. Bafang/8fun and CYC motors are two commonly used motor manufacturers that provide mid-drive motor kits.

      "Too long text on 5262, hi OP! this is in response to my post. first off, extremely wise words. i agree with what you said, and you’re right! i did want to point out a few things from reading the comments on this post though because i don’t think i was clear in my reason for posting. i mainly said what i said to vent and find community as i dont feel like a lot of people regret their choice, and my opinions are based solely on my experience and of course vary from person to person! the institution has a lot that’s wrong with it, as every school does, but my experience is based on my own life situations. im very much allowed to regret coming to this school and feel negatively towards my choice (not that you said im not). \n",
      "\n",
      "1) i commute to school and find it extremely difficult to attend classes (i am a full time student with a full time job) which i wasn’t expecting. SJSU is much closer to me in terms of commute so that alone would’ve helped a lot. i also have quite a few friends who go there and they enjoy it a lot! obviously my commute isn’t the institutions problem, it was my choice. i just didn’t realize how difficult it would be when i got in! \n",
      "\n",
      "2) im not lonely/depressed/don’t have friends at UCSC, i just overall feel like it is an environment (at least for my degree) where i am not truly learning much and there is little room for diversity in thinking. it 100% has something to do with my degree being psych, but knowing how UCSC’s student body is, i would’ve had a different experience at another campus (maybe not UC Berkeley..). i’m not planning to use my psych degree anymore because of my general displeasure for the psych community at the moment. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) the beauty of the campus is amazing! i absolutely find is gorgeous and that was actually one of the main reasons i wanted to go here. but in my time here, i’ve been to the beach once. i find myself extremely drained after classes and all i want to do is go home before traffic gets bad. but that’s just me, not the institutions fault. \n",

      "Too long text on 9607, I have a physics bachelor's and an astronomy PhD, and I think there are two possible ways I could interpret all the thoughts you're having now:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Maybe what you really want is to be an engineer. That's where you take relatively simple \"intro\" ideas like Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics and apply them to answer complex questions in real life. Not saying that engineering simple or easy, just that the underlying physics is not the upper level stuff like advanced E&M or quantum or whatever that is harder to touch with your own hands, and the interesting problems come from complex systems and the interactions within them rather than pure difficult concepts. If this applies to you, maybe consider an engineering masters. (side note: most research is similar to engineering in that you have a few basic concepts that you explore very deeply, so you only need a very focused area of expertise rather than a broad-based understanding. This is why grad students probably say that they don't use the material from whatever class you're talking about very often.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. You may need to sit down and think about what motivated you to be a physicist in the first place. Generally, people don't make it through a whole physics degree unless they have an innate interest in understanding more about the universe and how it works through solving problems. For me, having a broad understanding of the way *things* function and the systems in the entire world is very satisfying, and that makes it worth it to do very abstract problems. Knowing how electric fields propagate through a dielectric material isn't usually applied, but if I think about why the sky looks less blue on a smoky day or why a piece of calcite exhibits birefringence, then I remember my undergrad E&M classes and have the physics framework to understand it. I may not ever calculate Lagrangians of double pendulums anymore, but having that background gives me the ability to intuit whether a system I see in daily life may be chaotic. The things you're learning as a physicist aren't necessarily the content of the classes, but the way of thinking, and I guarantee you that if you've made it to the end, then you have a very good ability to see a system in the real world and simplify it into a model in your head so you can relate it to the things you already know. To me, that is the most satisfying and beautiful thing in physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if what you want is applications, go engineering (or research or lab work or programming or whatever). But if you want simplicity and understanding, then I bet you've learned more than you though you did.\n",
      "Too long text on 9613, Hey! First off, I feel you. It can be really hard to learn a bunch of theory without knowing why you're learning that stuff. A physics course has failed when it has only taught you the math and not the physical systems that it pertains to. The problem with a lot of E&M and Q. Mech is that real systems tend to be a lot more complex than most undergrad level theoretical models and so there are quite a few more advanced courses that you have to take before you get to explain some real physical systems. E.g. take atomic and molecular spectra that I deal with on a regular basis as an Astrophysics grad student. Although the time independent Schrodinger equation sets the foundation for atomic lines, there's a bunch more theory that deals with how light interacts with atoms before you start explaining the shape of atomic transitions and subsequently emission lines. Similarly in E&M, a lot of real life situations deal with collections of charges and thus their behavior is truly explained through a combination of statistical mechanics and electrodynamics. However, even the simple static, time-independent models are pretty close to the behavior of many many made systems, especially in electronics and electrical systems. Take for instance, QLED TVs. The Q part of the LED is basically a real life quantum particle in a box example. By changing the size of the box, you can tune the frequency if the light emission. Dielectrics are all around you. You have to worry about the material properties of air when designing electrical fuses. Coaxial cables have dielectrics in them. I can go on but hopefully you get the point. \n",
      "\n",
      "You mentioned that your interactions with grad students gave you the impression that these equations are largely useless. A lot of grads feel that way because they tend to focus on a niche problem many a times brushes the fundamental physics under the rug. My own research for instance deals more with CCD data (basically photographs) processing but it is very important for me to not lose track of the underlying physics. That's what I have an advisor for. :) He reminds me constantly of why I'm doing what I'm doing and forces me to think first about the science, i.e. the physical system I'm trying to understand, than  the methodology, i.e. the theory and the implementation of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like there were not enough lab classes in your curriculum which had you model real physical systems, especially electrical circuits, with all the theory you've learnt. May I know which lab classes you took?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I'm more than happy to point you towards relevant physical systems that can be explained by the theory you've learnt. DM me if you're interested in have a conversation.\n"

      "Too long text on 13746, I'm submitting my last paper ever for my degree on Wednesday, and I commuted from SJ regularly! It's definitely doable. However, I was a transfer student and took classes during both my summers here, started in summer term '22 and am finishing now in fall '23. Really condensed, and I was remote for maybe... four or five months during long Covid.\n",

      "- If you can put classes all on two days, do it. However, do not have it from 6am to 6pm for the love of god.\n",
      "- If your car has bad gas mileage, and you have the opportunity to do so, look into getting a more efficient vehicle. I downsized to a sedan from a compact gas SUV when I got into UCSC, and it helped offset costs from the commute.\n",
      "- Be extremely focused and plan out things in advance, course-wise. It sucks if you get bamboozled with a course that's only offered certain quarters and is at a stupid hour to drive to.\n",
      "- Little treats made the commute more bearable for me. I always got a croissant and matcha from Verve after my morning class and it was nice.\n",
      "- Pack lunch to save money, if you can, because it's a pain to get off campus and back if you have later classes.\n",
      "- Apply for the parking permit as soon as you possibly can. Get a remote parking pass, and you can take the bus (loop and metro). Loop will take you around campus, as the name implies.

      "Too long text on 13970, I pay $1300 + utilities for a single in an apartment with one other person. I'm in Santa Cruz proper but on the east side of the river which is a bit farther from UCSC and so a bit cheaper than housing on the west side. utilities and Internet come out to about $60-$100/month depending on how much we run the heater. Grocery bills have been going up, I used to pay about $50/week for food when I first moved year a year and a half ago, now it's like $75/week for food. I don't eat super cheap rice and beans type meals but I don't splurge on food either. I almost exclusively buy groceries and cook my own food, I very rarely eat out. \n",

      "I went to community college first, got a very specific degree that qualifies me for a job that pays $30+ an hour, and I work part time and go to school part time. But having that job also means I need to afford a car payment and gas to drive to San Jose and back 3x per week. I also picked up LSS tutoring this quarter to have some extra \"fun money\" because my other job and loan dispersements were really only covering my bills and essentials. I saved up a lot of money while in community college so I have a healthy savings account so I don't need to worry too hard about car repairs or vet bills for my cat, those I pay for with savings and then repay my savings account over time to get it back up to the amount I like to have. My mom is also available to help pay for things if I need it, she lets me use her Costco membership to get cheaper gas and pays for my cell phone and car insurance. She also co-signed my lease, so I didn't need to personally meet the income of 3x the rent requirement that most property management companies here have (but it also means she is on the hook for my rent if I ever don't pay it - which she would be willing to do anyway if something major came up and I needed to quit my job). \n",
      "\n",
      "It is expensive here, and doing CC first so I don't need to work full time at a minimum wage job but can instead work part time at a much more rewarding job was definitely the best decision for me personally. I also never lived on campus because by the time I transferred I knew I wanted my own bedroom because sleep is a challenge for me and I didn't want to deal with other people in my bedroom disturbing me when I was trying to sleep. I also wanted control over who my housemate(s) were (I only have 1 but I was willing to have a few if necessary) to make sure they'd be nice to my cat. Most people on campus are in triples, singles are apparently very limited. If you're willing to share a bedroom with 1-2 other people then housing can be much cheaper and living on campus can be a really convenient option.\n"

If that's something that would be a need of yours then I would reconsider. If your only housing accomodation you would need is an ESA, then I have not heard of people having any problems with those, as long as your ESA will get along well with roommates and you clean up after your ESA appropriately.\n",

      "The DRC has no way to actually force professors to give you academic accomodations that you request, and I have heard of people having problems with this. If the academic accommodations you need are extensive, I'd call or email the DRC at UCSC and explain what you explained above, let them know what accomodations you would need/expect, and ask if students ever have problems getting those accomodations. I don't know which accomodations tend to cause problems.\n",

      "As the other commenter said, the campus is physically very inaccessible. There is an e-bike share company that came in this year that seems to be pretty popular that you might have luck with, and there is also a disability van service, but I've heard mixed reviews on the van service's reliability. If you can get in and out of a bus (with stairs, no ramps) then loop busses should help a lot with your getting around campus as long and you don't schedule back-to-back classes, but there are some parts of campus that the loop busses don't get very close to and you may still have to walk around half a mile (with hills and stairs) from the closest bus stop to wherever you're going. I love taking my e-bike to campus as it helps me get around a lot faster, but I live off campus and can store my ebike on my 2nd-storey balcony where theft would be rather difficult. I don't know if the bike storage for people who live on campus would be adequate for you to not have an e-bike stolen if you were living on campus and wanted your own e-bike instead of using the e-bike share. \n",
      "\n",
      "From my experience at both community college and UCSC, community colleges tend to be much more disability friendly than UCSC is in basically all regards. I would look into community college and transferring as an option to save money and to also get used to college coursework somewhere where accomodations are more normalized and honestly where the professors actually give a shit about their students. Many lower division classes are so large at UCSC that the professors literally don't have time to care about any of their students, and the quality of teaching you'll get from TAs varies dramatically. At community college I found all of my professors very willing to make time to help students who needed it, and that's just not the vibe from professors here. Obviously your mileage may vary at a different community college than the one I went to, but I would check out your local community college options (or even cabrillo and de anza, which are the CC's closest to UCSC) and see if they look like a good fit for you, too, and then you can transfer to UCSC with a trabsfer agreement guarantee (for most majors), too.\n"

      "Too long text on 16343, 1. Professors are generally nice, though youll have the occasional difficult one like at any university\n",
      "2. depends on your major completely. Some majors will have high workload (particularily STEM), some will not. Most lectures are not really interactive, since they are a means for the professor to convey information to you, however if your major requires supplemental labs then those are more interactive.\n",
      "3. Food is ok, its sometimes hit or miss. Its meant to appeal to everyones palette. Havent personally lived in the dorms myself but I know people who have. It completely depends on the college you get in. Kresge will have super modern dorms, while Crown's dorms are outdated and really packed. On campus apartments are way better.\n",
      "4. This is probably one of the most liberal colleges in america. Actually I think it is ranked as the most liberal college in america. Racism is not at worry here. Diversity completely depends on what major you are, what college your at, etc. In general its a pretty diverse school, you can find the statistics online somewhere.\n",
      "5. Housing is expensive. When I was living in a triple in an on campus apartment I was paying around 1300 per month. Now I live off campus and was lucky to score a single for around 700 a month, but thats not the rule and more of the exception. On average, singles off campus are about 1300-1500 a month. Im a Computer Engineering Major, so I dont spend much on supplies, if at all. I do must of my work on my laptop or on my computer, and any material needed for my lab classes are provided by the university for me. Cant say anything about other majors though. Off campus, I spent around 200-300 a month on food, 100 on utilities. On campus, if you live in the dorms you are required to get a meal plan, which is a couple thousand per quarter? Check the dining website for meal plan prices. If you live in the on campus apartments it isnt required to get a meal plan. Apartments are only available to 2nd years and above. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, its a really nice university, but you have to realize that since you live in a different state, it will be more expensive in terms of tuition. If you have the means to pay for it and are willing to shell out 50k+ per year for a mid-low tier UC, then go ahead. If not, maybe consider other schools, even ones in your own state which can provide cheaper tuition to NY state residents.\n"

      "Too long text on 18959, Hey! AGPM and art student here. UCSC’s AGPM major is one of the best game design majors offered by a public school in the country, and *the* best in California. I personally love it, but because it’s so new it changes curriculums pretty routinely. Since switching affiliation from CS to the Arts, it’s become a lot more art-focused and we are no longer required to take STEM courses or collaborate with CS majors for our thesis projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foundational courses are entertaining and fun, but are also a LOT of theory. It’s not hard, but there is little to no objectivity besides the psychology around games, which you learn in your required lower-division courses. A but of a warning, though, many of the upper-division art courses that are important to the game design industry (like 3D modeling) are restricted to Art majors ONLY. It’s why I’m double-majoring, so I would think about that!\n",
      "\n",
      "As for college affiliation, it really doesn’t matter. You’re right about Porter having a large transfer community, but it’s also the “art” college. I think you’d be a good fit for Porter if you went there. However, Merrill (my affiliation) is often concerned with humanities and global consciousness and I’ve never had an issue making friends also in the arts despite it. The only thing affiliation matters for is choosing roommates for on-campus housing (you and your prospective roommates have to share an affiliation in order for you to request them) and the Core classes. However, transfers don’t have to take Core.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other comment mentions CSGD, but that program has fallen off recently from what I’ve heard from those in the department. UCSC is also a wonderful school with the only major issue being the housing crisis. Please don’t let that discourage you, though. This school is amazing at giving students benefits and resources, and you’re also guaranteed housing as a first-year transfer. It is ranked low on most college-ranking websites, but that’s often because UCSC doesn’t have many celebrity alumni nor one big major everyone’s gunning for. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d say you’re making the right choice in terms of AGPM/game design if you choose to come to UCSC for it. Hope this helps!\n"

      "1. Perhaps there is a disconnect from what you are studying/taught at lectures and what is on the test? Perhaps if you took a different approach in trying to first ask yourself a) what will be on the test, then working backwards from there you would do better? For example I took multivariable calc, and in the lectures there was some not-so-clear to me math logic stuff,..... **but** if I rmb correctly the test had mostly, if not all, algebra number type problems, not theory problems,.... so the smart thing to do for my grade would be to forget about the lecture theory stuff and focus on the algebra....It seems like you mentioned a similar thing \"I recognized none of the terms\". Maybe what is taught in lecture is different from what is on the test?\n",
      "2. Can you find some people in your class who are doing well? Can you ask them what they do and try to copy their formula/approach? Or a TA who has taken the class before? Perhaps they would study something different than you are?\n",
      "3. There might be a  disconnect between what you learn at school and what you will use on the job (depending on what you do). For exmaple, you might learn assembly language,..... but do you think most companies hire engineers to code in assembly? So rather than thinking \"i'm not cut out for cs\" on the basis of one class, perhaps take a bigger picture look regarding the relationship between your classes, your degree, and potential jobs for you post grad, and how they might not be as closely related as you might think.\n",
      "4. How is your mental well-being? What kind of image do you hold in your head about yourself?Are you getting enough sleep? Good food, water, salt, etc? Is lack of sleep or stress affecting your logical/cognitive mind capabilities making this class harder than it needs to be?\n"
