Not unless you give them $1,412/mo FOREVER"", ""IMO UC Santa Cruz striking graduate students who were fired were being unreasonable, and will regret being fired later.\n\nFirst of all, they were in the middle of a 4 year contract that their union voted on and ratified, and their strike was not sanctioned by their union.\n\nSecond, they were paid $2,434 monthly for their part time/ 20 hour a week Teaching Assistant positions (about $30 per hour). They wanted an increase of $1,412 monthly. That is a 58% increase, pretty pie in the sky for any job.\n\nThird, they were getting their tuition and healthcare paid for, also a signing bonus, and UCSC offered an additional $2,500 during the strike. Taken together, this is about 30-40k of additional compensation they were receiving. They also, of course, would get a degree out of it. So conservatively, they were earning about $50,000 per year for their 20 hour a week teaching jobs while getting a degree. Keep in mind that their jobs and classes were only 9 month out the year as well, so they had an additional 3 months to earn other income from other jobs.\n\nFourth, many graduate programs in other professions require you to pay for your tuition and health insurance. Ask any lawyer, physician, RN, pharmacist, social worker, MBA, physical therapist, CPA, architect to name a few. Many graduate studies require people to work part time or full time jobs and in most of these programs students generally go into debt.\n\nFifth, the undergraduate students who paid to be at UCSC were unable to get their grades for months. To make it even worse, strikes included actually disturbing students while taking midterms.\n\nI cannot comprehend how anyone could think it was worth it to loose all of their compensation and their graduate degree over roughly $12,000 per year (their requested increase). My bet is most will regret their decision to loose their degree over a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, I am not saying they don't have the right to strike. They can strike, fight for whatever they want, no matter how unreasonable. I am just saying this seems like poor decision making, and now that they are out of their jobs, they are going to have a hard time finding anything even remotely as well paying, not to mention the lost future earnings of not earning their degree.\n\nPlease let me know if I have made any factual mistakes or if you actually have responses to these arguments, when I have tried to present this info. in the past I was downvoted, but no one ever bothered to even try to argue a different position and/or their arguments were made in bad faith.

I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n\n4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n\nMoreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n\n5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n\n6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n\nHowever, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n\nSo yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n\n7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n\n8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n\n9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n\nYou also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n\n10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."", 'I think you\'re looking at the trees and not seeing the forest. If you take a step back it\'s easy to see that COLA is a bandaid on a bullet hole. The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they\'re asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. \n\nPlus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don\'t run out of money and aren\'t forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That\'s a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.\n\nI hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending.', 'You\'re right that COLA doesn\'t fix the underlying systemic issues.

Long term solutions that don\'t support grads in the short term aren\'t viable solutions.\n\nI\'m not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can\'t be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council\'s hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.\n\nThere\'s a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn\'t solely the city\'s fault, but also a result of the university\'s unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). \n\nBut somehow, I don\'t think any of that really matters to you.

Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. \n\nYou're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union.

To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault. It's ironic that in the same sentence that you would condemn me for calling you dishonest, you manage to misrepresent what I said.\n\nYour comparison between strikers and anti-immigration advocates relies on nothing but surface level similarities and ignores the underlying philosophical and ideological differences that structure those arguments. It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. \n\nIt is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."", '[deleted]', 'I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". \n\nI said it was dishonest to claim that the university\'s refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument?

Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be.

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? \n\n3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n\n4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n\nMoreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n\n5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n\n6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n\nHowever, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n\nSo yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n\n7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n\n8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n\n9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n\nYou also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n\n10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."", 'I think you\'re looking at the trees and not seeing the forest. If you take a step back it\'s easy to see that COLA is a bandaid on a bullet hole. The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they\'re asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. \n\nPlus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don\'t run out of money and aren\'t forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That\'s a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.\n\nI hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending.', 'You\'re right that COLA doesn\'t fix the underlying systemic issues.

Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades.

Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council\'s hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.\n\nThere\'s a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn\'t solely the city\'s fault, but also a result of the university\'s unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). \n\nBut somehow, I don\'t think any of that really matters to you.

Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. \n\nYou're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem.

You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates.""

By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault.

It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. \n\nIt is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."", '[deleted]', 'I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". \n\nI said it was dishonest to claim that the university\'s refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong?

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault.

Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be.

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don\'t include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be. I\'d actually describe it more as a coupon.\n\nYou might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I\'ve described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you\'d like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.\n\ntl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it\'s not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad', ""Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."", ""This is informative, thank you.

You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument?

I've had to fund my education completely out of my own pocket as I don't receive any form of financial aid, my family can't help me pay for any of it, and I couldn't get student loans due to the lack of a cosigner (I might be able to get a loan on my own now). I've been told the Ph.D. program for Applied Maths has guaranteed funding for the first 5 years in the program, but I assume that's purely for tuition and not housing.

For those that don’t know, around like week 3 of last quarter the cooling system of the drinks broke down. This meant no ice or cold drinks. Unfortunate, but things happen.

As the quarter progressed they put a bin out with ice for people to put into their cups but that was later taken away. The only saving grace up to that point was the juice machine which still served cold drinks, but because high demand the apple, orange, and guava drinks were out for the longest time. (No one would drink the cranberry one and I don’t blame them). 

Winter break came and went and I expected the time to be long enough for some type of repair or replacement to come through, but alas we were met with the same broken machine and empty juice dispenser. 

Now it is the second week back and the soda machine is completely down, not because of the machine about to be repaired but because of an ant problem (they were getting inside of the machine, I got some lemonade the other day and a few ants came it out) 

At this point my patience has come to an end and I am severely disappointed. I just want some ice cold water. Some of you might argue that I should just go to another dining hall but this is about the principle.","['Wow they had the exact same problem with the ants and the juice running out even from 2 years ago.\n\nNice to see that absolutely zero improvements have been made, despite all of the feedback forms that we filled.', 'yeah porter sucks, go to rcc instead', 'worst part is the food is more consistent at porter', 'https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=wdprime', 'i drink the cranberry one', 'No offense to anyone that drinks it.

So bad that posting an mp4 file to the class canvas would be 3x better,"['This was the first of a half dozen emails to ITS in the years since we adopted YuJa. \n\n> OMG YuJa sucks so so so badly (and what a dumb unmemorable name). It has the worst interface of almost any SASS service I\'ve ever encountered. It is fairly unusable. I know that Zoom probably charges you a hefty premium to store videos online, and I\'m sure YuJa allows you to store tens of thousands of videos much cheaper, but ho boy, my poor students are having a hellava time trying to get the videos they need. And the ucsc docs about YuJa just link to YuJa\'s general documentation which is disorganized and overwhelming. I\'m disappointed. This feels like a rush job.\n> \n> It has taken a while to try to figure out how the YuJa interface works. It is counterintuitive to say the least. Videos end up in a Default Collection? Okay. Can I publish them there? Apparently. no. I guess I have to publish them to my course channel?  Okay.  Can I sort them by say lecture and section recordings? Maybe?\n> \n> Can I provide a link to just the subchannel of videos?  Not that I\'ve found.\n> \n> Can I select several videos from my default collection to publish? It looks like I can select them one by one, or select all, but selecting items, the most basic function of any file management interface is not available. Please correct me if I\'m wrong.\n> \n> Grrr.  Teaching online is harder than teaching in person. Students are stressed. Faculty are stressed. Having tools that are required that create additional stress is not a great gift to overworked (and in my case underpaid) faculty.\n\nInterestingly, the response from the ITS dept responsible for YuJa said something like, ""we know. We\'re so sorry.""', 'Nah that response is crazy loool.\n\nThat\'s like turning a crappy lab and being like ""I know it\'s azz, I\'m sorry""', 'I think they were implying that it had been forced on them from above and now were responsible for dealing with the fallout', 'Bruh yuja buffers af and keeps asking me if I wanna resume at time x or go to beginning whenever I switch in and out of fullscreen.

I can't help but scrutinize the UCSC chicken mascot for its potential role in perpetuating gender stereotypes. There's an insidious suggestion that the chicken subtly reinforces outdated gender norms, serving as a puppet in the perpetuation of patriarchal ideals. The UCSC chicken mascot also serves as a tool for suppressing dissent. Those who challenge the status quo may face a peculiar form of ""eggsecution,"" as the clucker becomes an instrument of intimidation against dissenting voices.","['wtf is the UCSC chicken', ""For those of you who can't tell, this is very obviously not a joke and should be taken absolutely seriously."", ""It's pretty hard to tell considering this place."", ""Chicken is the gender neutral term for cock or hen. It doesn't require us to make a binary choice, it's just a chicken."", 'Did you read the post?

Let\'s unpack this complex issue:\r  \n\r  \nMascots and Symbolism: Mascots often carry deep symbolic meanings, embodying the spirit, values, and ethos of their institutions. The choice of a chicken as a mascot for UCSC, therefore, isn\'t just a whimsical decision; it\'s imbued with cultural and social significance. When analyzing mascots through the lens of gender norms, it\'s crucial to understand the layers of symbolism they carry and how these symbols are perceived and interpreted by different groups.\r  \n\r  \nGender Stereotypes and Animal Mascots: The link between gender stereotypes and animal mascots can be subtle yet pervasive. If the chicken mascot exhibits traits or is portrayed in a manner that aligns with traditional gender roles or stereotypes, it could inadvertently reinforce outdated norms. This is particularly problematic if these portrayals are not critically examined or challenged, thereby normalizing certain expectations about gender roles.\r  \n\r  \nMascots as Tools for Social Commentary: Mascots can also serve as tools for social commentary, either reinforcing or challenging societal norms. If the UCSC chicken mascot is used in a way that promotes patriarchal ideals, intentionally or not, it becomes a vehicle for perpetuating those norms. However, this also means that mascots have the potential to be reimagined or reinterpreted to challenge and subvert these norms, offering opportunities for progressive social change.\r  \n\r  \nSuppressing Dissent: Your notion of ""eggsecution"" as a form of suppression of dissent is an intriguing metaphor. In any institution, mascots can become symbols of conformity. If dissenting voices are marginalized or ridiculed using the mascot as a tool or symbol, this raises serious concerns about freedom of expression and the health of the academic community. The role of mascots should be to unite, not to intimidate or suppress.\r  \n\r  \nRe-evaluating Mascot Representation: It\'s important for institutions like UCSC to continuously re-evaluate their symbols, including mascots, to ensure they align with current values and ideals. This includes an assessment of how these symbols are perceived and whether they inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes or practices. Engaging with diverse community voices in this evaluation process is crucial for a holistic understanding.\r  \n\r  \nMoving Forward: Finally, addressing these concerns requires a multi-faceted approach. This includes open dialogues within the UCSC community about the mascot\'s role and impact, educational initiatives to raise awareness about gender stereotypes, and possibly reimagining the mascot\'s portrayal to align with inclusive and progressive values. Such steps can transform the mascot from a symbol of contention into one of positive change and unity.', 'Thank you, chatGPT...', '1. **Symbolic Depth:** Mascots embody institutional values, and the chicken choice at UCSC isn\'t whimsical; it holds cultural and social significance.\n\n2. **Gender Stereotypes:** If the chicken mascot aligns with traditional gender roles, it could reinforce outdated norms.

In any case, I go to check out and the transaction fails. I thought it was a glitch but then I tried apple pay and even manually adding the card details each time it would fail and not add anything to the balance. I didn't think anything of it but then a few days later the charges showed up on my credit card even though I received ZERO laundry credits. And trying to get this situation resolved is a nightmare. The live chat feature doesn't even work and claims that no agents are available no matter what time of day you do the chat and the phone support hold times are an hour or more and I waited that long for nobody to pick up and I just gave up and called Capital One to dispute the transaction and hopefully that works out for me or else I'm screwed.

Lesson of the story: If your laundry room still has the physical card readers be grateful and don't press the apple pay button multiple times even if it says rejected. It's still going to charge your card and you will still have zero balance.

196u0fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/196u0fk/terrible_living_space/,2024-01-14 15:43:07,Terrible living space,"It’s my first year. I like the campus, the classes, the nature, etc. but the floor I got put on sucks.

Most of the people on the floor formed one big friend group, and they’re acting like catty high schoolers. If you’re in the hall or the lounge, they’ll go out of their way to point, whisper, and giggle. They’re constantly yelling so you can hear them through the walls. They’ll openly (and loudly) talk shit about people for very small things. One guy took a shit around the same time they were flocked in the bathroom, and they’ve started making fun of him behind his back, simply for shitting. Another girl apparently likes having the lights in her room bright instead of dimmed, and they were calling her an “annoying, stuffy, cunt” for that.

About 3-5 people didn’t come back for winter quarter, and our RA told us it was cause they felt left out/unaccepted at the school. The RA basically just told everyone to be friendlier, but it hasn’t really had an impact.

On one hand, it feels dumb to leave over some immature bullying, but on the other… I’m not enjoying my time here, solely cause of them. I go to get water, they’re staring me down. I try to sleep, they’re screaming through the walls. I go into the bathroom, they go dead silent then start snickering. It’s also a super depressing reminder that I haven’t really made friends. They have parties, study groups, movies, etc. in the lounge, but if I go in there to try and socialize, they just act standoffish until I leave. I feel like an intrusion, even though I live on the floor and am allowed to be in the lounge. 

I spend most days going on long walks, and most nights falling asleep listening to all of them having a good time. I feel kinda pathetic about it, but I honestly just want to go home. Do I stick it out until next year? I really like everything else about the school, and this was my first choice.

Note that these ebikes are sold primarily in a direct-to-consumer model, so you may have a hard time getting the electronics and motors of these bikes serviced locally. If you like tinkering and are not afraid to learn about maintaining and repairing your bike, then these may be a good option.

Most kits are between a couple hundred to under two thousand, but there are generally no rebates or incentives available for conversion kits. If you go this route, you'll be able to get a higher power motor than the ones on street-legal ebikes sold in stores. You will also have better self repairability and compatibility, as most name-brand motors (Bosch, Shimano STEPS, etc) are locked down and not easy to fix. I only recommend mid-drive motor kits due to the hilly Santa Cruz terrain. Bafang/8fun and CYC motors are two commonly used motor manufacturers that provide mid-drive motor kits. If you use Bafang, get their previous gen motors (BBS02 or BBSHD) since their newest ones (M-series) seem to going the Bosch route and will only work with Bafang-specific batteries.\n\nSince you will be commuting on public roads, to remain street-legal you must limit the power of your motor to under 750W (through setting current limits in software). This only applies to custom kits, as nearly all store-bought ebikes are <=750W.\n\n---\n\nWhether you're new to riding or have experience, I'd recommend shopping for an ebike at a local bike shop. They can provide test rides and ensure a good fit for both your riding style and use case.

196jhgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/196jhgw/calculus_help/,2024-01-14 08:19:31,Calculus Help!!!,"Hello,

**I took Math 11A during the fall quarter of my freshman year in 2020.** I was struggling majorly with online classes at home due to the lack of structure and my own lack of discipline, and passed the class by the skin of my teeth; I was not as lucky with a couple of other classes that I took that same year of quarantine. Before this, in high school, my relationship with math (specifically calculus) was already less than stellar. So once I passed Math 11A, I felt so drained by the class that I was in no rush to take 11B.

Back to the present - **I'm now a 4th year that is taking Math 11B, and I am afraid**, to say the least. I attempted taking the class in earlier years, but dropped the class more than once because of how advanced the contents of the first lectures seemed. I had hoped to take a lower-ranked calc. class as a primer to 11B, but I found that I was kept from enrolling due to the credits I had received for 11A. My current professor seems to be in-touch with the knowledge level of the class, but I feel this will be of no benefit to me because of how 90% of the class has taken 11A recently, in the previous quarter. Already, I feel incompetent regarding my ability to complete the basic homework assignments that have been posted for week 1; as well as fully comprehending the lectures we've had.

I'm writing up an email to the professor explaining all of this and requesting resources. Besides attending sections, LSS, office hours, reading behind in the textbook, etc., can anyone else offer other advice/resources? I am to the point in my degree where I need to take and pass this class now, or else I won't be able to take my other pending major classes (due to 11B being a prerequisite) and still be able to also graduate by my approved quarter. I am of course open to additional tutoring, and would appreciate any available tutors to shoot me a message.

Thanks!","['I devoted a summer session to 11B. It was literally the only thing I did. Lecture was in the morning. Library all afternoon.', 'Attending LSS 3x/wk is what got me through that class, also having a regular study group. Calc is just something you have to spend time with, it is helpful to have tutors but the main thing is getting a lot of practice in', 'Couldn’t agree more. There’s no substitute for talking and working it out.', ""Khan academy was a huge help to me. I was in a similar boat, I took the calc AB AP test my junior year of high school in 2016, went to community college where I took no math, and then took calc 19B in winter of 2023. Yes, that is a 6 year gap between taking those classes. It was hard, and probably I spent a lot longer on homework than my peers did, but I made flashcards with the info from trigonometry/precalc/calc 1 that I had forgotten and needed to review on Khan academy, and then kept them handy while doing homework. then I made flashcards with the new concepts from calc 2 that I wanted to remember and kept those handy too. I was taking it asynchronously online so I could use those notes on exams, but if you're taking it synchronously and have closed-note exams I'd make flashcards and then quiz yourself as often as you can to really learn them. Going to LSS tutoring (remember they *also* have a math study hall which would be a great place to review calc 1 and older math topics), office hours, etc is a great plan and should set you up for success."", 'Hey I’m taking math 11b this quarter too. Do you have tamanoi? You can dm me about specifics that you’re worried about. I tutored a lot of classmates last quarter and they did really well.', ""As others have said, Khan Academy and OChem tutor are both very useful resources with calculus. As a math tutor, I would like to emphasize some common mistakes that those who aren't as mathematically inclined and those who are both tend to struggle with.\n\nMy first piece of advice is, know your algebra. One thing you'll hear a lot about calculus is that the hardest part of it isn't the calculus concepts themselves, but the algebra behind them. If you have your algebra mastered, you should have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of every concept in calculus itself.\n\nMy second piece of advice is, write out every single step. I can't even remember how many times I've gotten a problem wrong because all that was missing was a single negative sign that was the only roadblock to a correct answer. I can recall when I was taking 23A, I was stuck on a hw problem for 3 days, in which I was doing everything right except I had forgotten a single negative sign in a long extensive calculation.\n\nThird, trust but verify. On tests, if you have the time don't just submit the test early, go through as many problems as you can again to make sure that you're getting the exact same answers twice through. It will definitely create a solid portion of your test that you will confidently know is irrefutably correct and give you a lot of ease as you wait for scores to come out.\n\nFinally, since you're taking 11B, you're going to be doing Taylor Series approximations. Always make sure that you have all the basic series memorized, how to simplify factorials, and make sure you have your derivatives down. These are likely going to be the biggest roadblocks from my experience. When you get to them, make sure you have your sin, cos, ln, and e\\^x series memorized. Additionally try having a strong foundation on power series if possible.\n\nI hope this helps and if you ever begin to struggle on any of the concepts, my services are open."", 'Organic chemistry tutor explains most calc concepts on youtube.', 'I volunteer to take OPs class for them.', 'Couldn’t agree more.

I really feel for these people because that is how I felt halfway thru my first quarter last year as a transfer student.

I'm a non-traditional student (25+ yr old), who hasn't experienced a full life, but has experienced enough to know that the grass is always greener on the other side. That's the human mind that has been conditioned to constantly project itself into a future scenario that will surely bring fulfillment. It's *that school*, or *that relationship*, or *that job*, that will bring lasting satisfaction. Spoiler alert, it's not. Don't become like the majority of our society that thinks it's the next big thing that will make you happy. I sure was guilty of this when I set many expectations for what ucsc would be like.

Truth is, you can go to any school Reddit page and find dozens of students who lament on how awful their school is and how they regret going there. I'm serious, look for yourself. Go to the reddit pages of Cal, SJSU, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, CSULB, CSUF, etc, and search for the key words ""lonely"", ""no friends"", ""regret"", and ""depressed"". How is it that students from all these different universities with no affiliation are having the same negative experiences?? This is a topic that can be talked about at length, but I think it stems from several things i.e. social media, societal factors mentioned previously, lack of purpose, lack of spirituality, and a lack of responsibility.

I'm not selling you anything here. The one thing I want to impart on my fellow classmates is that you have a choice in a only a few things in life, and that's it. You have choice in your response to external events, in your attitude, and in your perception of circumstances. Learn to see what you have control over and what you don't and your life will change drastically and almost immediately. Take it from a student who was in community college for 6 years and who took 8 years to transfer. Enough credits to have a B.S., 11 withdrawals, several failed classes, several different SSRIs and psych meds, a few years of heroin/fentanyl addiction, homelessness, and living in halfway houses.

I promise you this is an amazing school. Believe it for yourself and start acting in that way, and you will begin to have a positive experience.

I’ve put a lot of effort into being the best RA I can this year, but many of my residents are honestly just out of control and it’s starting to make me feel discouraged. This is my third year as an RA (south side of campus) and last year was great. It was super smooth, and my residents were awesome, respectful people. Don’t get me wrong, most of my residents this year are awesome too! But man, a handful (about 15) of the people in my building are just straight disrespectful. This post is more just a call for help and advice on what I should do. I’m thankful for the fact that I have housing with this job and nothing beats that but everyday I look forward to graduating. 

A handful of the guys in the building don’t shower and when you walk past a handful of the rooms on my floor, you definitely get a wiff of some kind of stench that is not very pleasant, and it can be strong🤮Like showering and washing your clothes are very basic but necessary tasks.

Secondly, the yelling. I think it’s great that some
people are so enthusiastic and excited to socialize but must we yell when people are trying to sleep? I’m fine with any noise during the day but come on. Can’t we just tone it down to a talking level, and go outside if we want to rough house when it’s past quiet hours? I’m okay with the noise most of the time but then when I think about the fact that it’s after quiet hours and people are honestly trying to sleep, and how i’ve given my residents dozens of polite reminders of the quiet hours to there face, and how it is my job to make the building a comfortable living space, it makes me angry because like, where is the respect? I keep getting this feeling that it is because I am a woman that they don’t listen to me but also expect me to tell them to do their laundry?

About the room: single room with a shared bathroom, full kitchen and living area. I have some furniture but not a lot  💀.

About me! I'm currently a senior CS: Game design major and I'm extremely clean and quiet, I'm totally fine with overnight guests but would like a heads up prior. I'm hopefully in the area for the next year until I graduate.

Ever since then I’ll experience really random episodes of heavy Deja Vu which trigger a panic attack. I have medication for the PTSD but I can’t take it in public because it makes me extremely sleepy. Like I will fall asleep and not be able to make it back to my dorm levels of sleepiness. When I am in my dorm, I can feel like I’m dying in peace and take my meds, but I don’t know how to handle this when it occurs during class. Anyone who experiences attacks want to share their strategies?","['I’m not an expert, and didn’t get professional help for a bout of panic attacks, but I found a way to deal with them. Also PTSD, but no meds. I started to recognize them when they first came on. I said to myself, “you’re not dying, you’ve been thru this before and you know what it is”. Mine manifested in heart attacks, but obviously, I never had a heart attack nor died. Remind yourself right now that despite feeling like dying, you never have (I’m assuming, ha). Over time, just recognizing that overwhelming feeling of impending doom washing over you and then telling yourself, i know what this is, I’m not going to die and breathing and letting it pass thru you worked for me. “This is a panic attack. I’ve felt it before and lived thru it every time. I’m not going to die and it will be over soon.” Experts might say that this is ridiculous advice, but it worked for me. I had an attack driving in traffic once with my whole family in the car and managed to not wreck the car, which was an accomplishment. I also haven’t had one in more than 12 years after adopting this strategy. Maybe you can start this process once you start feeling Deja vu and tell yourself, “hey, I know what’s coming next”. \n\nI hope something eventually works for you; real panic attacks suck. And these days, everyone says they’re “having a panic attack” when they’re simply experiencing anxiety, but they have no idea. They’re scary.', 'Thanks for the advice! I will definitely try that', 'Might be worth checking with DRC and maybe CAPS for advice on how they might be able to give some accommodation for your situation in the classroom setting.', 'I’ll look into that, especially if I have to take my medication since it somewhat acts like a tranquilizer and if I have to take it before class, then I’m not making it to class', 'Hey so sorry this is happening! I went through a physically and mentally traumatic event smack in the middle of college and it made sitting in class physically challenging because of the pain for the rest of my 4 years. Sometimes the bumps going over the train tracks on Laurel St. near 7/11 would make me cry when I rode the bus lol.\n\nAnyway, u/noLeading-6909\'s advice is excellent! I would like to add that it is worth talking to your professors and TAs about this if you\'re comfortable. You certainly have formal recourse through DRC and so on, which I highly recommend, but going to an instructor after class and mentioning to them, as I did, ""hey I have neck pain so severe I can\'t focus so sometimes I need to step outside for a breath"" could be very effective. It certainly helped me feel less anxious about ""getting in trouble"" or whatever when I was already feeling bad in the moment.\n\nAll that being said, I hope you\'re able to feel better in the future and wish you the best!', 'Thanks for the advice! I will definitely try that', 'I’ll look into that, especially if I have to take my medication since it somewhat acts like a tranquilizer and if I have to take it before class, then I’m not making it to class']"

Life insurance serves as a crucial financial tool that provides protection and peace of mind for you and your loved ones.

1.Financial Protection for Dependents:

If you have dependents, such as a spouse, children, or aging parents, life insurance ensures they are financially protected in case of your unexpected death. The death benefit can help replace lost income, cover living expenses, and maintain their quality of life. #lifeinsurance #lifeinsurance #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsurancepolicy #lifeinsurancebroker #lifeinsurancematters #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsuranceagents #lifeinsurancematters #ffl

The lighting around campus sucks and it’s dark by 5pm, and I’m a 20-30 walk from my car at east remote..

Enrollment was only 8-9 k students…it was super unusual to see anyone on the road or trails. \n\nSo…with the explosion of student population at 17k…is it really still that empty? I used to walk home from Downtown Seattle to the Capitol Hill neighborhood in WA state and it was among a gaggle of people…I know a city vs campus comparison…but you can’t be the only person trekking to East remote….right?

Are the parking lots 24 hour now or are they restricted only during business hours? I was reminded about how a friend of ours would drive from remote to Merrill C lot to go to a night class. (There was no 9 or 10 then, but if your class is further in I’m guessing they also have C lots? I’m assuming that is what you mean by upper campus? Walking from your class to the closest c lot might be more well-lit and populated…that is, if the lots are still only restricted during the day and your class begins late enough?', 'I’m pretty sure East & West remote are the only 24hour lots. Then a majority of the other lots require certain permits or become available to all after 8pm. My classes start before that & end a bit later than that so I’m kinda screwed. There’s a few park mobile options but people jump on those spots immediately so they aren’t reliable. I’m not familiar with C lots, probably need a permit for those? Not sure', 'C-lots were “College” lots. They were the lots located at the main/driving entrances to the colleges. I have no idea now if these permits still exist given the increased number of students and new buildings. They were super limited as you were competing for spaces with faculty and more expensive as they put you closer to your college. \n\nYeah…the lots only required permits during the day…if they’ve extended them to 8pm that blows that idea.', 'Yeah they definitely don’t make it easy. The east & west remote permits are outrageous. I want to say that the college lots you’re referring to require a specific type of permit that most people can’t get, then there’s a few park mobile spots (like 3-8 spots maybe) in most of those college lots but it’s an absolute joke.

That, of course, does not mean such a circumstance is impossible, or that every college student is completely trustworthy, either, but it’s certainly on the safer end.

I thought feminist women hated men, but it turns out feminism benefits us all in the long run. Feminism is about fighting for equality for everyone. Just think of this class as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Because that’s what intersectional feminism does. It provides a set of mental tools to analyze and resist inequality.\n\nWhat I learned in that intro feminism class is what allowed me to better understand myself enough so that I could eventually begin to transition. Thankfully, at UCSC, feminism is almost always intersectional, so definitely stay in it. 🙂👍🏼 \n\nIntersectional feminism is about promoting a world where people are free to flourish into their own authentic, unique selves, independent of rigid binary gender roles. \n\nPeople are skeptical of feminism because the dominant narrative in society is that feminism is anti-male. While it is true that some feminist women are unironically misandrist, they shouldn’t be used to smear the rest of us good intersectional positive feminists. Most feminist women are pretty chill once you get to know them. They just want equal rights. \n\nAlso, I found the initial readings that we were assigned in my intro feminism class to be very hard to follow because it was packed with feminist terminology and feminist theories I hadn’t been educated on yet.

We expect to return to normal operation levels over the coming weeks. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department, with assistance from the California Highway Patrol, is continuing to actively investigate the cause of the crash.  \nOut of an abundance of caution, we took our 35-foot buses out of service to conduct additional off-cycle inspections. We also asked the CHP’s Commercial Motor Carrier Safety Unit to inspect these buses, and that process is ongoing. We’ll be undertaking independent third-party inspections of all of our 30-foot buses as well, and will return them to service once that process is finished.  \nProviding safe and reliable transportation service is a campus priority. Our bus fleet undergoes routine and regular maintenance as well as pre-trip inspections. As part of our normal process, the bus fleet also undergoes regular inspections by the CHP.  \nAs the 35-foot buses clear the CHP inspection process, we are bringing them back into service. It is possible that riders will experience transit delays until that process concludes in the next week or so.

She was there at that one too, chanting and protesting. They had formed a human chain around the building and were denying people access. I needed to get in for a meeting. I walked up to her and said I recognized her from the tree protest. I pointed out that it was a bit ironic to be protesting against growth at the first of the month and then protesting tthe campus wasn’t growing fast enough to make itself accessible two weeks later. I told her the meeting I was trying to attend was about attracting more to represent students.

I read that it used methods of physics and chemistry to study astronomical objects and phenomena. In high school I  took chemistry honors, physics honors, and plan to take AP physics senior year, what are your guys's thoughts on this as a major for me at ucsc ( or perhaps other schools) ?  

side note is my grade was not that good in chem honors, but i still rly enjoyed the class and I can maybe get a rec letter from the chem teacher as well luckily i  have good grades junior year with an A in physics honors tho. 

I think id enjoy this course as I enjoy physics currently and also enjoyed learning the  bit of quantum physics my chemistry teacher taught, also the career options after r good.

pls gimme ur thoughts thanks.","['Bro no one gives a shit about your high school classes.

I'm planning to enroll in ""Adv Comp Security CSE 233-01"" and was hoping to get some insights from students who have previously taken this course. I'm particularly interested in understanding more about the course structure, especially regarding the final assessments.

Are there any final exams in this course?
Is there a significant project component?
Are students required to do presentations?
Any insights on the overall difficulty, workload, and the nature of assignments would be highly appreciated. Also, any tips for succeeding in this class would be really helpful!

I have been fighting to find a place to park my car overnight during the school weeks. I go home every weekend to take care of my family about 2 hours away. I was not able to get a parking spot through UCSC and any of the churches and was wondering if there are any other options for me. I only use my car on fridays to get home and come back mid day sunday. I am willing to buy a parking spot (on or off campus) if someone doesn’t need it or looking into any other options.,"['I would file an appeal for a permit, I believe there is one for traveling to care for others. That might be your best option.', ""Try posting on Nextdoor to ask a homeowner if you can rent a parking space on their property. It's a great way for seniors who don't drive to get  a little income."", 'Parking on California Street is practically free for 3 days at a time. Parked there for about 2 or 3 weeks and moved my car periodically and never saw a ticket. its also a pretty short walk from the 15/18 bus stop on mission.', 'A lot of parking spots on campus do not require a permit after 7-8 pm or on weekends', ""is that official policy or does parking enforcement just not check after that time? asking because i've heard this before, but not sure how true it is."", 'from what i rember taps stops checking after 830pm on weekdays', ""TAPS lists on their website that people can park for free from 5pm until 7 or 8 am in east remote. At some of the colleges there are parkmobile options beginning at 4:30pm and lasting until 8:30pm, when parking is free there. Since East Remote is free after 5 and you can get parkmobile day spots, I would recommend going at night to snag a spot (when commuter students leave) and basically paying the day rate until Friday -- only really as a last resort since its pricey and its also hard as a commuter student to find really any other parking on campus.

As a prospective student, I have some questions mainly to help me prepare for my housing situation. The next 3 paragraphs will consist of me providing background and what I plan to do. 

Just to give an idea of where I’m at financially, I expect to have around $65,000-$70,000 by the time I start. I also have no debt.

I hope to live alone on campus (potentially with a roommate off campus), and just pay rent. Based on SC apartment prices, I don’t think I can afford to live alone.

For tuition, I’ll very likely use loans and be either a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant to offload some of that cost. In addition, I’m also planning to be aggressive with summer internships after my first year in order to gain valuable experience and obviously make some extra money. STEM internships seem to pay well, so I am hopeful.

In terms of housing, how difficult is it to get housing on campus? How about off campus? I prefer to have a single, or live in an apartment/house with a roommate, where we have separate rooms. If it’s relevant, the most I’m willing to spend is $1,500 per month.

I saw that The Graduate Apartments are within my budget, so if anyone has any experience there, please do share as much as you are comfortable with.

Please drop any and all advice you might have with UCSC and housing.","['*In terms of housing, how difficult is it to get housing on campus?

I liked the quietness and how secluded it was from main campus. The lounge room has a TV and vending machines. Sinks, fridge, freezer in every quad. \n\nCons: The walk to get out is so annoying. No sunlight really gets in there because it’s basically in a ditch. No stoves in the quads so if your quad isn’t close to the village kitchen then it’s a little bit of a walk. ~14 people per quad. With so many people the fridge and freezer can get cluttered if your roommates are messy. Walls are thin. My single was at the end of the hall and I could hear people talking from the kitchen and rooms that were down the other end of the hall. Heating did not work in my building (C1) and they never fixed it throughout the entire year. We were freezing.']"

The course has little homework and primarily focuses on collecting 10-20 references for your topic and slowly developing your paper in LaTex.

He’s such a weird and cool guy and had some really fresh perspectives on life that I really appreciated and still think about now that I’m in industry. I really admire him for leaving industry and returning to academia. He would often talk about how he commutes down from San Francisco area and stops and looks at the water and so on. His teaching style is a bit more loose and unconventional and stresses the more important points on things than focusing on the details.', 'Veenstra is still teaching it but his class is full; Pusukuri is no longer at UCSC. 13S is getting curriculum changes, Alvaro\'s class will be doing the new curriculum and Veenstra\'s class will be updated with parts of the new curriculum. Veenstra\'s section will be harder and Alvaro\'s section will have ""a bigger focus on problem solving and debugging"" and clearer assignments.\n\n13S is mainly a class on programming in C, and it also involves using a Linux terminal. I\'d recommend that you know at least basic Linux commands and maybe some C too.', 'Had Alvaro for CSE 138. His lectures were pretty good and I learned a lot. However, he basically had the TA run the entirety of the assignments which quite frankly turned out horrible (assignment manual filled with typos / misinformation, vague requirements, little to no sample test cases). This was incredibly frustrating considering I poured hours into these assignments, optimizing my code and checking for edge cases, just to lose 50% of the grade because some crucial information was missing from the manual. Hell, for one assignment, the grading script was straight up wrong and we had to debug it and complain on the class discord for them to fix it. In summary, take him if you want good lectures, but be prepared for an overall poorly ran class.', ""From the stories I've heard, Professor Alvaro seems to care very little about the overall well being of his students.\n\nHis curriculum was Quin's original CSE130 curriculum as his first year as a teacher. For those who don't know, this involved a very complex multi threaded web server. From rumors that I've heard, professor Alvaro did not provide any of his students with the test cases for their grade.\n\nI cannot begin to tell you the amount of sheer frustration and anxiety that is felt from designing a complex program with hundreds of pieces of data moving around in a concurrent multi threaded fashion and not having a single clue what you're being tested on, not having a single clue what data is being sent that's making your program fail, not having any ability to replicate the bug.\n\nSecondly, I heard professor Alvaro fucked up majorly on his exams and refused to admit his wrong doing, but rather shrugged his shoulders and expected his students to deal with the consequences of his errors.\n\nI also heard he doesn't wear shoes during class which is just fuckin weird."", 'Nah he cares', 'First, Prof. Alvaro cares deeply about students and what they learn. Computer systems is a tough subject, and many reflect their opinions of it onto the instructor. I say this because my first two offerings of CSE130 had nearly identical content, but the pilot offering was much more highly regarded. The reason? It was a smaller class, and was optional at the time (as a replacement for CS111), so the students who took it _wanted_ to be there. In most cases, your **attitude** determines your opinion about the instructor.\n\nOh, and the curriculum Prof. Alvaro used in his first 130 offering was mine — it was before Quinn joined the department.', 'Hope retirement is going well for you professor', 'The people who recommend Alvaro are usually masochists that think poorly structured and unnecessarily difficult CS classes make you a better programmer 😂 13S is a tough class in general but I’m very glad I didn’t have to take it with Alvaro…', 'Nah he cares', 'First, Prof. Alvaro cares deeply about students and what they learn.

When I look back on classes I’ve taken, everything just feels like a fever dream. My notes are just a bunch of equations with zero context. Every time I try to learn a new concept, there’s always a couple very niche calculus proofs you need to do or some other background information which a whole other class could be dedicated to, but it’s all just glossed over. 


I’ve also been doing research during this time and have used nothing that I have learned in class for my research. I honestly have no idea wtf any of my classes are for. I’m glad we went over how to solve the time independent Schrödinger equation for a free particle, but what the actual hell do I need this for and in what context is this happening in besides very specific circumstances in a lab? Nothing I have learned seems practical, and if it is practical then the department is very good at keeping that information secret. I’m glad I know how to analyze a dielectric inside an electric field, but to be honest if you were to ask me if a material is a dialectic or not I’d be fucking stumped. And if you were to ask me how to create an electric field in real life I’d tell you that I have no idea. Theoretically you move the electrons but HOW and WHY. When would I ever be calculating an electrical field in my life? What possible job would make me pull out my calculator for this? I’m sure there is one, but no one has bothered to inform me of it in my class.

Everything just runs together in my head, and I feel like I haven’t learned anything because I can’t apply anything I’ve learned except to stupid word problems like “where is this particle in a infinjte well?” Yeah I could probably calculate it for you with the right equations but wtf is an infinite well in actual life? Everything just seems like a bunch of equations which popped out of thin air that I have to apply calculus to in order to solve, I have no context for anything that I’m doing. I literally need a class just to go over every single equation given to me in the past two years that would explain its derivation and what REAL LIFE context you would ever need to know this for. 

Okay my rant is over","[""*I feel like I haven’t learned anything because I can’t apply anything I’ve learned except to stupid word problems* \n\nYou've spent the last 4 years in academia.

Basic Newtonian physics went over actually life problems that I encounter everyday. My thermodynamics instructor was able to create problems which explained how engines and refrigerators worked. The beginning electrical courses taught practical things like how a light bulb works. Then in my upper division courses it all went to shit. We started talking about very specific things that don’t apply to any scenarios I encounter every day, like the double pendulum. The only double pendulum I’ve ever encountered in life had been the one that they built in ISB so students could see a double pendulum, because no one uses the double pendulum. They also had questions like “you have a mental sphere with a single electron in the center” ??? What is the practicality of THAT?? I feel like some of the math I am using and these problems were invented by physicists who smoked crack and then did shit like “you know how there’s one pendulum? Let’s add another” or “let’s go to my lab and add a charge to a mental sphere. Why? Who the hell knows, but at least an undergrad student will have to learn the math behind this shit.” All my classes use to be word problems that made sense: “a car driving on a road”, “a battery connected to a circuit”, “an AC unit trying to cool a house” and all those practical word problems just became abandoned for specific theoreticals in my upper division classes', 'As a physics major who graduated 2 years ago, unless he goes to grad school, the OP will never use that physics knowledge again.', ""I just don't think that's true.

I graduated a year and a half ago.', ""this! even though your classes ranges from 100-500, it's all really 101 in the big scheme of things"", 'Seems like you are asking about electrical engineering which is where you would apply all of that.', 'I have a physics bachelor\'s and an astronomy PhD, and I think there are two possible ways I could interpret all the thoughts you\'re having now:\n\n1. Maybe what you really want is to be an engineer. That\'s where you take relatively simple ""intro"" ideas like Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics and apply them to answer complex questions in real life. Not saying that engineering simple or easy, just that the underlying physics is not the upper level stuff like advanced E&M or quantum or whatever that is harder to touch with your own hands, and the interesting problems come from complex systems and the interactions within them rather than pure difficult concepts. If this applies to you, maybe consider an engineering masters. (side note: most research is similar to engineering in that you have a few basic concepts that you explore very deeply, so you only need a very focused area of expertise rather than a broad-based understanding. This is why grad students probably say that they don\'t use the material from whatever class you\'re talking about very often.)\n\n2. You may need to sit down and think about what motivated you to be a physicist in the first place. Generally, people don\'t make it through a whole physics degree unless they have an innate interest in understanding more about the universe and how it works through solving problems. For me, having a broad understanding of the way *things* function and the systems in the entire world is very satisfying, and that makes it worth it to do very abstract problems. Knowing how electric fields propagate through a dielectric material isn\'t usually applied, but if I think about why the sky looks less blue on a smoky day or why a piece of calcite exhibits birefringence, then I remember my undergrad E&M classes and have the physics framework to understand it. I may not ever calculate Lagrangians of double pendulums anymore, but having that background gives me the ability to intuit whether a system I see in daily life may be chaotic. The things you\'re learning as a physicist aren\'t necessarily the content of the classes, but the way of thinking, and I guarantee you that if you\'ve made it to the end, then you have a very good ability to see a system in the real world and simplify it into a model in your head so you can relate it to the things you already know. To me, that is the most satisfying and beautiful thing in physics.\n\nSo if what you want is applications, go engineering (or research or lab work or programming or whatever). But if you want simplicity and understanding, then I bet you\'ve learned more than you though you did.', 'This is by and far the best answer.\n\nThank you for writing this out, I really appreciated it.', 'Perfect response. Physics equips us with problem solving skills, and engineering/research is a great place to put that to use. I switched my career goals before I graduated because I knew some type of engineering would be more fulfilling for me!', 'If you have any electives left take one of the applied physics classes. And like someone said look into grad school 👍🏿', 'Yeah I think op’s missing the application of what they’re learning', 'Such is the difference between theory and application! I felt similarly frustrated with my theoretical classes because we didn’t even delve into theory that was recent whereas my applied classes we were actually creating things and having conversations about how theory in practice impacts people & the things around us. Consider every theory class you’ve ever taken as the base knowledge you’ll need to be able to put into practice to problem solve at a job', ""Hey! First off, I feel you. It can be really hard to learn a bunch of theory without knowing why you're learning that stuff. A physics course has failed when it has only taught you the math and not the physical systems that it pertains to. The problem with a lot of E&M and Q. Mech is that real systems tend to be a lot more complex than most undergrad level theoretical models and so there are quite a few more advanced courses that you have to take before you get to explain some real physical systems. E.g. take atomic and molecular spectra that I deal with on a regular basis as an Astrophysics grad student. Although the time independent Schrodinger equation sets the foundation for atomic lines, there's a bunch more theory that deals with how light interacts with atoms before you start explaining the shape of atomic transitions and subsequently emission lines. Similarly in E&M, a lot of real life situations deal with collections of charges and thus their behavior is truly explained through a combination of statistical mechanics and electrodynamics. However, even the simple static, time-independent models are pretty close to the behavior of many many made systems, especially in electronics and electrical systems. Take for instance, QLED TVs. The Q part of the LED is basically a real life quantum particle in a box example. By changing the size of the box, you can tune the frequency if the light emission. Dielectrics are all around you. You have to worry about the material properties of air when designing electrical fuses. Coaxial cables have dielectrics in them. I can go on but hopefully you get the point. \n\nYou mentioned that your interactions with grad students gave you the impression that these equations are largely useless. A lot of grads feel that way because they tend to focus on a niche problem many a times brushes the fundamental physics under the rug. My own research for instance deals more with CCD data (basically photographs) processing but it is very important for me to not lose track of the underlying physics. That's what I have an advisor for. :) He reminds me constantly of why I'm doing what I'm doing and forces me to think first about the science, i.e. the physical system I'm trying to understand, than  the methodology, i.e. the theory and the implementation of it.\n\nIt sounds like there were not enough lab classes in your curriculum which had you model real physical systems, especially electrical circuits, with all the theory you've learnt.

If so, then your undergrad coursework might be missing applied projects.

I live in the bigger room so my rent is 53%, and the smaller room will be 47% — $1725. Adding utilities and internet the cost comes to approximately $1950 a month.
Pets are welcomed, I love animals and I often bring my girlfriend’s dog here.
I am looking for a clean, quiet, and non-smoking person. Also, since my job is work-from-home, I prefer not to have friends over too often. Please dm if interested.
Thanks!",['Feel free to send me the images.']

With an interest in game design, I really enjoyed the content and had a lot of fun learning about it. 

TLDR: group assignments were tough as peers may not have coding experience/proficiency and you are essentially required to learn a (possibly) new coding language in 10 weeks on top of the lectures in class :)

If you are like me: gathering prerequisites to declare a CS:GD major, you might think to yourself: ""Maybe this would be a fun educational experience for me (despite not needing the class for any GE or as a prerequisite).""

And it was! But for the wrong reasons.

First of all, the description on the UCSC website for STAT 80A is not accurate. ([https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/](https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/))

It does not highlight the **weekly labs** that you are going to be doing learning R (the coding language). Leading up to a final project that is a 4-5 page report using your newly acquired R prowess.

This leads up to my first gripe about the class. These lab sessions are an hour long each. We have maybe 9 lab sessions total. This class does not have any prerequisites. You can see how these things combined can make the class a bit of a struggle for students that take it without math or coding experience. **1 hour a week is not enough time to learn a language** you SHOULD assume is new to students! 

Leading to my second gripe: **an imbalance in group work**:

To counteract this lack of time, students are asked to put themselves into groups of 5 to work together on the projects, but when some students have coding experience and some do not, this creates a discrepancy where the students with experience have to choose between teaching their peers (which should not be their responsibility) and finishing the lab quickly.

What confuses me even more is that the TA that I was in contact with told me that having all the students learn R was not the goal, and that ""the more students with more coding experience were expected to carry their peers."" 

This goal makes even less sense as we begin to be asked to put the names of the people who worked on the project on the lab, and add percentages of group work distribution on our final project. These submissions aren't even anonymous. **Why breed unnecessary conflict??**

The goals that the TA and professor express aren't aligned with reasons to incorporate group work. If there were some prerequisites in math and coding added to the course, students would be able to know what they're getting themselves into.

However, this doesn't mean that I didn't have a poor learning experience. In fact, it was greatly education for me to complete **every** lab assignment, as I was able to practice my proficiency in the language and prepare myself for the final project. 

That is why I think that this class was a great learning experience for me. I hope this warning goes out to the students taking the class as though it is on an interesting topic, you have to be prepared for the workload (if you get unlucky, but what are the chances).","['Thank you for this post, I was thinking of doing Stats80A and this was a really helpful insight.\n\nEdit: grammar', 'no problem! im glad i could help, i think it might also only be offered as an 8 am but i may be wrong/they may offer it at different times depending on the quarter', 'Thanks!', 'Lol I wish more people made posts like these forming schedules would be a lot easier than navigating through a mix of 1&5 stars on almost every rate my professor.', 'Ill try to make more if I ever come across something like this again haha', ""This post kinda makes me glad they canceled it last Winter, I hate having to deal with student-lead group projects and I wouldn't have had a clue going into it.

>**Reimagine METRO service changes start December 21!**  
>  
>Experience more service, higher frequency, simpler routes, and better transfers with Reimagine METRO Phase 1. This wave of change starts Dec. 21 and includes 15-minute all-day service on Routes 18 and 19, serving UCSC and Downtown Santa Cruz. Other important changes include the return of express service between Watsonville and Santa Cruz during busy peak commute times, as well as an all-new Route 3 connecting Live Oak and the Capitola Mall with UCSC.    
>  
>[Reimagine METRO](https://scmtd.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=795a642df7ef3f7fdb27a8931&id=2ade104bf7&e=8404a49d40) is the result of a comprehensive community engagement process conducted in 2022 and 2023. At full implementation, systemwide ridership is anticipated to double to 7 million rides per year.  
>  
>Specific improvements starting December 21 include:   
>  
>**Simpler routes linking Santa Cruz, Capitola, Cabrillo College, and Watsonville.** New Routes 1 and 2 replace the old routes 69A, 69W, and 71. (Freedom Boulevard outside Watsonville and Aptos High School will now be on the new Route 73.)  
>  
>**Simpler and more frequent service in Watsonville.** We’re replacing several of Watsonville’s once-an-hour routes with a simpler pattern of routes that mostly run every 30 minutes.  
>  
>**15-minute frequency to UCSC.** Continuing the improvements started in September, Routes 18 and 19 on the west side of Santa Cruz now run every 15 minutes at most hours.  
>  
>**New direct service linking UCSC, Santa Cruz, and Live Oak.** New Route 3 provides direct service to UCSC from Capitola Mall, Live Oak, and Seabright. It’s a combination of old routes 10, 66, and 68, with some added changes due to the upcoming Murray Bridge reconstruction.  
>  
>**Faster service to Scotts Valley and San Lorenzo Valley.** All route 35 trips will now run direct between Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley, without deviating to Emeline Ave. An extension of Route 4 will serve that area instead.  
>  
>**Service to La Selva Beach** on extended Route 55.  
>  
>To help riders get accustomed to the new Reimagine METRO network, METRO will offer free fares countywide on all services, including fixed-route, Highway 17, and ParaCruz, from Thursday, Dec. 21, 2023 to Thursday, Jan. 4, 2024.  
>  
>In addition, METRO will make changes to its fare and pass offerings. Beginning Dec. 21, METRO will offer free transfers for riders on all routes, including Highway 17. Transfers will be issued only after a request from a rider and will be effective for 2 hours. Transfers from a local to a Highway 17 bus will require payment of an “upgrade fare” equal to the difference between a local and Highway 17 fare.    
>  
>Ticket vending machines (TVMs) will be retired on Dec. 20, coinciding with the start of the two-week free-fare period. After Jan. 4, tickets and passes can be purchased online at [scmetro.org](https://scmtd.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=795a642df7ef3f7fdb27a8931&id=569f918436&e=8404a49d40) or via METRO’s Splash Pass app, available for download on Google Play or the Apple App Store or at one of METRO’s Customer Service Windows located at Pacific Station and the Watsonville Transit Center.

All contributions benefit people within Santa Cruz County. 

I'm not affiliated with this group, just found out about online and thought I would share it since it seemed cool.

Link: [https://donatemeals.ucsc.edu/MealPlanFlexiDollarDrive/Fall2023](https://donatemeals.ucsc.edu/MealPlanFlexiDollarDrive/Fall2023)

Here's some more info (from the website): 

For every $1 raised, Second Harvest Food Bank provides 3 healthy meals. In Santa Cruz County, 1 in 3 people face hunger and Second Harvest is working hard to feed people who need food now and to advocate for policies that tackle the root causes of hunger. Every month, 65,000 local residents count on Second Harvest to avoid missing meals, empty stomachs, and impossible choices between food, housing, medicine, and other necessities. The organization sources over 8 million pounds of food each year and distributes it to 100 food pantries, schools (including UCSC Slug Support, SUA, and Family Student Housing for campus Basic Needs food pantries), soup kitchens, group homes, youth centers, and Second Harvest Program sites. 

100% of the proceeds from this campus-wide holiday donation drive benefit Second Harvest and Santa Cruz County residents. The work the food bank does is important to reduce food insecurity that many people in our community experience. You can learn more about Second Harvest at [thefoodbank.org](https://thefoodbank.org)

Ways to donate: Donate all types of Slug Points, Banana Bucks, and Flexi Dollars, including Points/Bucks and Flexis from Blue, Gold, or Banana Slug Points plans, and RA meal plans. You can donate from 5 to 50 Points/Bucks and Flexi Dollars (in increments of 5).

Takes 2 seconds, better to donate them than have them go to waste yk (Apologies in advance if this has already been posted before).

I will be attending UCSC in the Fall of 2024 and I have some concerns about the price of living or if its even worth living in Santa Cruz vs where I live now. Currently I live in San Jose, and it's about a 45-minute drive (with no traffic) to Santa Cruz. Since Im transferring I was planning on living on campus since It's the easiest thing to do and puts me closer to the school which helps since I will be doing research under professors along with normal upper div classes. But the money concerns came up, and I realized how much cheaper it would be to just live at home for a couple of quarters instead of living in santa cruz instead. Basically, what I'm trying to ask is: Is it worth living at home with my parents to save money for a couple of quarters and just commute to school every time I have class? I don't get the best mileage (about 25-26mpg) and it takes around 50ish dollars to fill up my tank each time. Im not sure how much it would cost to live in SC but the only thing I would really want if I lived there was my own room and a parking spot, I don't care how many roommates I would have as long as It's quiet. Would it be significantly cheaper to stay home and commute and save versus just living off-campus nearby?","['tbh u will be saving a lot in rent bc nothing here is cheaper than $1200 for your specifications. don’t forget to factor in wear and tear, plus slippery traffic conditions on the 17 in the winter', 'How bad are the roads?

Really condensed, and I was remote for maybe... four or five months during long Covid.\n\nMy recommendations:\n- If you can put classes all on two days, do it. However, do not have it from 6am to 6pm for the love of god.\n- If your car has bad gas mileage, and you have the opportunity to do so, look into getting a more efficient vehicle. I downsized to a sedan from a compact gas SUV when I got into UCSC, and it helped offset costs from the commute.\n- Be extremely focused and plan out things in advance, course-wise. It sucks if you get bamboozled with a course that's only offered certain quarters and is at a stupid hour to drive to.\n- Little treats made the commute more bearable for me. I always got a croissant and matcha from Verve after my morning class and it was nice.\n- Pack lunch to save money, if you can, because it's a pain to get off campus and back if you have later classes.\n- Apply for the parking permit as soon as you possibly can. Get a remote parking pass, and you can take the bus (loop and metro). Loop will take you around campus, as the name implies. Metro is the regular bus which is free to students who provide current student ID. Don't take the metro if you can afford to wait for a loop bus.\n- I don't know how bad the bus is nowadays but I doubt it's improved much. Wear a good mask if you want to avoid getting sick, it's close quarters most of the time. The bus is usually late, so factor that into when you leave your house.\n\nFor me, it was a little harder because I can't climb uphill very easily due to my health, but if you're in better health than me, I think it'd make it a lot easier. If you are in similar health, uhhh... I sometimes had friends drive me up to social science hill and drive me back to my car. So that's an option!

Also, the 17 isn’t the safest during the winter months. This could also mean sacrificing time from studying so it’s important to weigh your options.

Taking an incomplete on one of my courses due to severe mental health problems. If I take a second incomplete will that impact my financial aid for the Winter 2024 Quarter?

I\'m in Santa Cruz proper but on the east side of the river which is a bit farther from UCSC and so a bit cheaper than housing on the west side. utilities and Internet come out to about $60-$100/month depending on how much we run the heater. Grocery bills have been going up, I used to pay about $50/week for food when I first moved year a year and a half ago, now it\'s like $75/week for food. I don\'t eat super cheap rice and beans type meals but I don\'t splurge on food either. I almost exclusively buy groceries and cook my own food, I very rarely eat out. \n\nI went to community college first, got a very specific degree that qualifies me for a job that pays $30+ an hour, and I work part time and go to school part time. But having that job also means I need to afford a car payment and gas to drive to San Jose and back 3x per week. I also picked up LSS tutoring this quarter to have some extra ""fun money"" because my other job and loan dispersements were really only covering my bills and essentials. I saved up a lot of money while in community college so I have a healthy savings account so I don\'t need to worry too hard about car repairs or vet bills for my cat, those I pay for with savings and then repay my savings account over time to get it back up to the amount I like to have. My mom is also available to help pay for things if I need it, she lets me use her Costco membership to get cheaper gas and pays for my cell phone and car insurance. She also co-signed my lease, so I didn\'t need to personally meet the income of 3x the rent requirement that most property management companies here have (but it also means she is on the hook for my rent if I ever don\'t pay it - which she would be willing to do anyway if something major came up and I needed to quit my job). \n\nIt is expensive here, and doing CC first so I don\'t need to work full time at a minimum wage job but can instead work part time at a much more rewarding job was definitely the best decision for me personally. I also never lived on campus because by the time I transferred I knew I wanted my own bedroom because sleep is a challenge for me and I didn\'t want to deal with other people in my bedroom disturbing me when I was trying to sleep. I also wanted control over who my housemate(s) were (I only have 1 but I was willing to have a few if necessary) to make sure they\'d be nice to my cat.

Are classes in person? Night time? How many hours a day do I have to be in school? Or meet with an advisor? I’m just not quite sure how this works. 

I saw online that the program can be completed in 1 year but most people complete it in 5. Why is this? Cost? Course availability?

Unfortunately unless ur work is directly aligned with ur phd research I doubt you will be able to do both at the same time. Phd is a full time job.

Your research has to add something new to your field, unlike a Master's project which are often rehash of other work. Typically you take 10 units each quarter until you pass your qualifying exam to be considered full time.\n\nAfter the qualifying exam, you are considered advanced to candidacy. This means your focus is now on research and most phd students don't take classes anymore.

It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN\'s team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. \n\nZionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it\'s the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it\'s fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven\'t existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest.

Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.\n\nMany Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.\n\nIf the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory.

You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN\'s team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. \n\nZionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it\'s the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it\'s fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven\'t existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest.

Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.\n\nMany Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse.

It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN\'s team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. \n\nZionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it\'s the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it\'s fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven\'t existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest.

Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off.

The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse.

You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN\'s team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. \n\nZionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it\'s the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it\'s fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven\'t existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest.

Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.\n\nMany Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse.

You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there.

Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.\n\nMany Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.\n\nIf the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory.

It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You\'re operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they\'ve never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN\'s team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. \n\nZionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it\'s the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it\'s fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven\'t existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest.

I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can\'t see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".\n\nJews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn\'t yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.\n\nMany Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.\n\nIf the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US.']"

Yes I posted before, but I am posting again!! I'm taking Biol 105 with Needhi Bhalla, and it's such a pain in the ass.

I'm looking for a tutor who can help me master the material before our midterm on Thursday. LSS and TA's have been no help. They keep things too simple, and Needhi teaches at a DEEP level.

Happy to send notes, and any resources. Can pay too! I bombed the first two exams and really NEED to pass, so I will pay!!

I can help with chemistry or physics too if you need it!

Please PM, chat, or comment if you can help!

Thank you so much, I'm super desperate :(.

For a physically disabled student, UCSC is the least friendly of the UCs, almost entirely because of the landscape. It’s in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. UCSC definitely tries but it’s hilly with tons of tree roots and levels. If you have a car with a placard, it’s significantly easier as most buildings have disabled parking close by. But otherwise it’s going to take a lot of time to go anywhere. Most students find it a challenge to get from class to class within the 15 minute break.', 'do they allow electric bikes on campus and if so do you think that would work getting from class to class? I can ride them for short distances but i know some campuses banned them', 'Yes! E-bikes are essential with the hills.', 'Thank you!!', 'The DRC at UCSC is super helpful. I can’t speak for whatever department you plan to join, but I forum no problem moving in with my ESA. We did have to share a room, but my roommates were awesome. There are 24 hour libraries/writing centers, lots of variety at the different dining halls, and plenty of clubs and activities to join. \n\nThey have a program for DRC students that digitizes all your textbooks if you want, so you can listen to them as audiobooks. There’s math tutoring. There’s the potential to request accommodations for more time on tests and assignments. You might qualify for short breaks during exams. \n\nAnd there is a vanpool you can call for mobility issues and rides to your campus if you are physically disabled. We had a man in a wheelchair in our year, and he said they were super accommodating. \n\nI will say if you are physically disabled it will be hard to access some of the best parts of campus life, hiking in the old growth preserve. I got published for some photography I did back there. It was awesome. \n\nI found no resistance to the accommodations I requested, but again that’s professor and department dependent. \n\nFinally, there is a reputation for research being highly accessible for undergraduates (if you keep up in your studies and make an effort in office hours). \n\nAll in all, despite it being an extremely expensive place to live, the busses around town allow students to venture out and make it back to campus easily.

Our campus buses, housing, and classrooms are not accessible at all. When I came to UCSC I never imagined I would need an accessible space, but now that I do, I regret coming to UCSC. What UCSC does to for disabled people is the bare minimum, often only doing things so that they don't get sued.   \n\n\nYes we have a disability van service, but only because our campus buses are so old they're exempted from the ADA (buses maintained by the university so we don't have to comply with the ADA). Our campus environment routinely includes sharp hills, small pathways, and dirt walk ways. It is literally easier to walk on the roads in some places, then it is to take the paths since they make the roads flat but the paths not.   \n\n\nAs for accommodations, the DRC at our school is overwhelmed and unable to manage or help most disabled students. Students have had to form a DSU (Disability Student Union) in order to get the DRC to fix or even address some of the basic problems on campus. I have routinely had professors deny accommodations or provide lack luster attempts to meet them.   \n\n\nIf accessibility is your main concern when choosing a school, don't come to UCSC"", 'ah dangit, thank you for letting me know! this was my dream school, idk why people cant just treat disabled people fairly', ""To be very clear - a lot of the issues stem specifically from the fact that the school is built into a hill side, with ravines, elevation, and nature preserved. \n\nSo some of the charm is unfortunately exactly what makes it tough. And the campus transit systems as mentioned are largely designed to travel a main circuit around the campus, but doesnt' inherently help you get up/down some of the main hills. There are supplementary shuttles and the van as mentioned, but the core reality is the landscape makes it pretty challenging. \n\nIt can be done but be prepared to be a bit frustrated at times. And frankly you'd likely want to not stack classes back to back as it can take even able bodied people 15-25 minutes sometimes to get cross campus. Let alone someone needed to take more time to stay stable/safe."", 'They are being treated fairly. What you want is special treatment.', 'absolutely not lol not disabled friendly', ""I have heard of people who get a DRC accomodation letter for a single and still get placed in a double/triple/quad because there's no available singles. If that's something that would be a need of yours then I would reconsider. If your only housing accomodation you would need is an ESA, then I have not heard of people having any problems with those, as long as your ESA will get along well with roommates and you clean up after your ESA appropriately.\n\nThe DRC has no way to actually force professors to give you academic accomodations that you request, and I have heard of people having problems with this. If the academic accommodations you need are extensive, I'd call or email the DRC at UCSC and explain what you explained above, let them know what accomodations you would need/expect, and ask if students ever have problems getting those accomodations. I don't know which accomodations tend to cause problems.\n\nAs the other commenter said, the campus is physically very inaccessible. There is an e-bike share company that came in this year that seems to be pretty popular that you might have luck with, and there is also a disability van service, but I've heard mixed reviews on the van service's reliability. If you can get in and out of a bus (with stairs, no ramps) then loop busses should help a lot with your getting around campus as long and you don't schedule back-to-back classes, but there are some parts of campus that the loop busses don't get very close to and you may still have to walk around half a mile (with hills and stairs) from the closest bus stop to wherever you're going. I love taking my e-bike to campus as it helps me get around a lot faster, but I live off campus and can store my ebike on my 2nd-storey balcony where theft would be rather difficult. I don't know if the bike storage for people who live on campus would be adequate for you to not have an e-bike stolen if you were living on campus and wanted your own e-bike instead of using the e-bike share. \n\nFrom my experience at both community college and UCSC, community colleges tend to be much more disability friendly than UCSC is in basically all regards. I would look into community college and transferring as an option to save money and to also get used to college coursework somewhere where accomodations are more normalized and honestly where the professors actually give a shit about their students. Many lower division classes are so large at UCSC that the professors literally don't have time to care about any of their students, and the quality of teaching you'll get from TAs varies dramatically. At community college I found all of my professors very willing to make time to help students who needed it, and that's just not the vibe from professors here. Obviously your mileage may vary at a different community college than the one I went to, but I would check out your local community college options (or even cabrillo and de anza, which are the CC's closest to UCSC) and see if they look like a good fit for you, too, and then you can transfer to UCSC with a trabsfer agreement guarantee (for most majors), too."", 'Do not choose this place. I’ve heard so many disabled persons complain and I do sympathize with them, but UCSC is the LEAST accessible campus for people w disabilities. Most athletic people here find themselves winded walking across campus, that says a lot.', 'DRC is great and can help a lot, but traversing this campus as a disabled person is a nightmare.', ""I agree with some other people on the general inaccessibility for the physical disabilities. I have totally seen people do it who are wheel chair users though. They will let you allow your ESA if you live on campus. The DRC kicks absolute ass. I can now say this firmly comparing it to the grad school that I'm at now where the disability offices sucks hard core. Furthermore, UCSC is the school that introduced me to disability studies! There is a better culture there than I've personally experienced otherwise. I hated to leave it."", 'As far as academic accommodations go, it is not difficult to get them from the DRC. But the way that accommodations are done at ucsc require you to at hand in your accommodations without anonymity. And it’s not uncommon for professors to either reject some or all accommodations. Other schools do anonymous grading or at least anonymous accommodations so you do not have that power dynamic.', 'Personally I’ve heard negative things including someone who had to call the ambulance on themselves or having to treat their hidden disability themselves because the health service wouldn’t listen to them.

I live on campus and UCSC\'s TAPS has a van called ""Disability Van Service"" and they would pick you up at a specific area and drop you off wherever you need to get to. It was very nice but DVS only goes to specific areas and sometimes you\'d need to walk for a pretty long to get anywhere regardless. I ended up going home because UCSC was not very disabled accommodating (uneven paths, unwalkable areas). I can’t speak much for mental disabilities. They do have the DRC (disability resource centers) which they\'re are able to assist in requesting accommodation for classes and such. Hope this helps :)', 'I recommend calling and connecting with the DRC apartment ahead of time and asking them questions !!', ""Believe it or not, I had a friend in a wheelchair that got around pretty well on campus. It's a large hilly campus but you'll meet so many great friends that will help you out and disability services will be on top of your needs but it's a great question to bring up just because it is such a beautiful scenic area. You probably already do this but you must allow yourself plenty of time to get to your class because even with students with a good walking stride, it takes time to get around.

One of my professors has been holding my accommodations over my head all year and not allowing them unless I provide additional medical records for him.

I tagged UCSC and I am probably going to end up going here. I am from Orange County California. Plz give me an honest review of what life is like at UCSC in regards to housing, party culture, things to do outside of campus, what people are like,  what’s with the stoner and drug stereotype? Etc. Thanks again.","[""It's going to be the opposite of Orange County. UCSC is a good school, but it can have a niche culture, and it does have its issues like housing. You'll be able to fit in, but I wouldn't expect something like a USC or UCSB environment and something closer to Cal, except maybe more counterculture vibes and perhaps a worse housing situation depending on how you evaluate it."", 'Thank you I appreciate it!', 'To start, the area is incredibly beautiful. By far my favorite part of living here. The social clicks are kinda tricky if you dont make a friend group early on, but if youre pretty extroverted you should be fine. You should research the different residential colleges though to make sure you end up in the right social environment. Its a little tricky to get around if you wanna explore outside of the immediate area, but the bus system will connect you around town and theres plenty of things to do. The academic experience is different for every major but for impacted majors classes usually fill up super fast. I recommend walking to your classes instead of using the busses but its a big campus so walks can take up to 25 minutes. Dining hall food is alright, nothing special but not terrible. There are a few alternates in terms of food that you can use your meal points on too. Im not a huge partier but ive been to a few of the forest parties and ive had an amazing time at all of them. The nightclub in downtown also hosts events that lots of people say rlly good things about. Either way, i think its a super cool school and i would say you should definitely keep looking into it! if you have any questions feel free to ask', 'Hey what club are you talking about!', 'The catalyst.', 'Ohh yeah I always categorized it as a venue, not a club lol', 'A lot of clubs for a lot of stuff. Very weed heavy culture so most parties are naturally kick backs with a lot of smoking unless it’s a house party off campus. Mostly chill vibes. In terms of education if you put in the effort and use the resources you’ll get a whole lot of it. Staying fit mostly consists of doing sports and other activities in clubs since the gym is so small. Food is decent, nothing terrible but not great either. The campus itself is beautiful and I would recommend if you can to never take the bus and walk everywhere. Nothing is more than a 20-30 min walk away. So if you have time to do so I’d strongly recommend it. Again strong emphasis on clubs, there will 100% be something you’ll enjoy and find interesting. The people in my 4 years there were always accommodating, nice, non combative and chill. Honestly a good school if you don’t fall into the “stats and rankings” pit. That negativity is the only thing that will ruin your experience.', 'I feel like it’s polar like it’s either the perfect school for you and you’ll love it or you won’t. If you haven’t already you should definitely visit before making a decision. Touring and talking to students really helped me solidify my decision to come here and I have no regrets!', 'Yes, UCSC is the type of place you either love or hate. Definitely visit — more than once — and join the UCSC related social media to get a feel for the overall experience. Also be prepared financially to spend a bundle on housing…and if you don’t like weed, don’t come here.', 'Housing is difficult to get and expensive. There’s no sugar coating it, it’s one of the craziest housing markets in CA.\n\nThere isn’t really a party culture here. People hang out with friends at kickbacks mostly. You gotta go to at least one forest party just to experience it imo, but they get old quick. There’s a couple campus clubs and frats that host parties but it’s mostly freshmen who go to those. The dive bars downtown and elsewhere in SC are fun for 21+. There’s not much nightlife for the clubbing type of people, but I personally love the “grungier” side of SC’s bars. Some students in bands put on garage shows, which are fun. A lot of people smoke weed, and those who don’t are not bothered by it. If you’re bothered by weed, don’t come here. 4/20 is basically an unofficial holiday here.\n\nPeople here are generally really easy going and friendly. The school is very left leaning, no surprise there. The academic culture is not at all competitive. Sometimes the activism culture can feel performative, and on the other hand there’s a lot of people who get pissy and grumble about any sort of protest even though they chose to go to a school that’s known for counterculture and activism. Both are annoying.\n\nStudents aren’t really involved in the town community, which is a shame. Campus is kind of its own entity. The community is pretty skeptical of students because of that. It’s a shame bc the locals here are friendly and there’s so much rich culture (surfing, remnants of anti-Vietnam), but very few people at UCSC seem to want to interact with them much.', 'as someone who spent a few years already here at ucsc and has visited ucb, LA, and orange county i’d say they are quite different. to my knowledge of the few places i’ve been, la feels like a more sketchy berkeley while orange county would be like the rural outskirts but i do love the outlet there. ucsc is more like small city with beautiful campus and beach but lacks a ton of big brands. if you want some big brand products you’d have to try online to closest would be San Jose. Here downtown i’ve only seen a few clothing stores, jewelry, crafts store, food, food, and oh did i mention food? haha\n\nit’s definitely nicer than orange county id say but has less and is just a smaller city', ""It's a very small town with very little to do, so if you don't figure out a way to have fun on your own accord you'll be extremely bored. Seeing that you're from OC, I would definitely visit first and just ask random students any questions you have. Most ppl here are very nice compared to other schools they won't mind answering your questions. \n\nComing here will be the absolute opposite of the OC/LA experience. There is no city life unless you want to drive up to the Bay all the time, but it's a lengthy drive and it's not really worth it unless you're doing it with other people. If a big city-esque nightlife/social scene is really important to you, I would definitely think twice before coming here. \n\nI won't get too much into the educational side as it's major dependent, but I'd say the professors are pretty good (lots of good ones, some bad ones) and you'll learn a lot from every course if you really put the effort in. I'm a CS major for clarification. The GE's here are definitely lacking compared to other schools (just not as many interesting offerings); I'd honestly say that most GE's I took felt like a waste of time so do with that what you will.\n\nI think the worst part of this school is the lack of facilities/amenities. We just simply have nonexistent/lacking facilities here. We have one, tiny gym in a pretty inconvenient location and it is extremely crowded 80% of the time it's open (Expect a 1 hour workout at your commercial gym to take 2 hours here). We have one, small basketball court which is also used for badminton, volleyball, and other sports so you'll basically never have an opportunity to use it. There are also no real community centers that make it easy to meet people (for reference UCSD has sky lounges, cafes, restaurants on campus, computer labs, and they just built a brand new esports center just for students). Our dorms don't have communal kitchens, we don't really have central quad areas, central marketplaces, or anything like that. \n\nTL;DR: Good people, nice-looking campus, generally good professors/classes, small boring city, terrible/nonexistent amenities at the school"", ""> We have one, small basketball court which is also used for badminton, volleyball, and other sports so you'll basically never have an opportunity to use it.\n\nLast I checked, both fieldhouses had basketball courts, and there are outdoor ones at East Fieldhouse as well.

I go to a college preparatory school so around now is the time where we all start kinda focusing on what colleges we want to get into. I’m really into UCSC not only because the environment is literally beautiful but they also offer majors that I’m into. I just wanted to ask a few questions because most people in this group actually go. 

1. How are the people/professors? Would you say it’s very cliche to the movies or a calming environment? 

2. Is the workload terrible or over stressing? Are classes very interactive or typically lecture style?

3. What’s the housing and food situations like? Are dorms good? Is the food bad?

4. How is the diversity? Would you say racism is common?

5. How much do you pay per year for housing, exams, supplies, etc? (If answering in a range or approximation is possible, please do that!)

Those are currently my main concerns so if anyone would take the time to answer, that would be great!

Have a good day!","[""1. Professors are generally nice, though youll have the occasional difficult one like at any university\n2. depends on your major completely. Some majors will have high workload (particularily STEM), some will not. Most lectures are not really interactive, since they are a means for the professor to convey information to you, however if your major requires supplemental labs then those are more interactive.\n3. Food is ok, its sometimes hit or miss. Its meant to appeal to everyones palette. Havent personally lived in the dorms myself but I know people who have. It completely depends on the college you get in. Kresge will have super modern dorms, while Crown's dorms are outdated and really packed. On campus apartments are way better.\n4. This is probably one of the most liberal colleges in america. Actually I think it is ranked as the most liberal college in america. Racism is not at worry here. Diversity completely depends on what major you are, what college your at, etc. In general its a pretty diverse school, you can find the statistics online somewhere.\n5. Housing is expensive. When I was living in a triple in an on campus apartment I was paying around 1300 per month. Now I live off campus and was lucky to score a single for around 700 a month, but thats not the rule and more of the exception. On average, singles off campus are about 1300-1500 a month. Im a Computer Engineering Major, so I dont spend much on supplies, if at all. I do must of my work on my laptop or on my computer, and any material needed for my lab classes are provided by the university for me. Cant say anything about other majors though. Off campus, I spent around 200-300 a month on food, 100 on utilities. On campus, if you live in the dorms you are required to get a meal plan, which is a couple thousand per quarter? Check the dining website for meal plan prices. If you live in the on campus apartments it isnt required to get a meal plan. Apartments are only available to 2nd years and above. \n\nIn the end, its a really nice university, but you have to realize that since you live in a different state, it will be more expensive in terms of tuition. If you have the means to pay for it and are willing to shell out 50k+ per year for a mid-low tier UC, then go ahead.

This will include a huge overhaul in routes, including ones that go to UCSC.

How is the physics culture? Is it more collaborative or competitive? What is the general tenor of the faculty and their views on work-life balance? 

How competitive is the program to get into? I know this is difficult to say since it usually depends heavily on faculty fit and available funding. 

What’s living in SC like? I grew up in the PNW and went to undergrad in Colorado so being so close to some great nature is very attractive to me. What is there to do outside in terms of hiking, climbing, etc? Generally what is the cost of housing? Is there cheaper graduate student housing available? 

Appreciate any info you can provide!","['You can hike, climb, trip or you can trip while hiking or trip while climbing, you can ride your bike around here and you get to be around lots of nature at ucsc. Much cool very fun', 'From what I heard when my friend applied to the UCSC astrophysics program there were 7 positions for 300 applicants, but that was also right after Covid. Everyone I’ve talked to in the physics department has been very nice as well. Haven’t met a single person I’ve found rude.\n\nAs for work life balance. From talking to a few of my professors it seems like they have minimal work life balance, but it also seems like that is by choice because of how much they like the field.\n\nSanta Cruz as a town is fine. There are some nice locations but everything closes too early for my liking. However it is undoubtably amazing for hiking, mountain biking, climbing, surfing and anything nature. The campus is right in the middle of the redwoods and has some world renowned mountain biking trails.\n\nHousing however is a big issue, Santa Cruz is also very well known for us cost of housing issues.']"

Which to me is already a red flag to be a republican in 2023. My first conversations with him were about who he supported, he used to support trump and used to support DeSantis. His reasoning for not supporting them are very telling to me. He said that he doesn't support Trump cause he's an idiot(more respectable of him to admit it) which i interjected about how he also violated the constitution and he pretended as if that was a debatable topic cause its just a fact lile gravity. 
Then he said that he doesn't support DeSantis because he's weak, not cause of DeSantis book banning or his handling of covid, etc etc and said that we need a strong leader. 

Then we talked about Israel and how it's a war crime for them to block all access to water and food and electricity when the genocide started. He said they had to it because hamas would steal it from the people which was stupid and basically justifying starving people to death which already irk me and made me not like him.

Then my most recent conversation with him was about how Israel knew about the October 7th attack and he at first dismissed it. Then u told him it was not that reported and he said, ""I have to look into that more but I doubt their reporting"" and I said, ""well I do to because they tend to be very bias in favor of Israel not the other way around"" then he said that biden is putting restrictions on Israel and I interjected saying that no he just gave them full access to our military stockpile and he said they just stopped it. Then I said we'll that's a good thing cause they're committing war crimes, and the motherfucker said, ""well Israel has to commit war crimes"" I can't make this shit up!!!!! And I just walked out and he wanted to get into it as if it was a debating topic to say a country of any kind has to commit war crimes!!!

There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there\'s no option other than going in and taking them out.\n\nIsrael doesn\'t get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can\'t believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can\'t believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas\'s responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel\'s coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.\n\nIsrael ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.\n\nGenocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.\n\nThe West Bank is ""controlled"" by the PLO, but Hamas, PIJ, and the Lion\'s Den operate actively in the West Bank, particularly in areas like Jenin that the PLO can\'t control effectively. Areas controlled by those groups are without doubt valid targets.\n\nAllied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel\'s response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can\'t let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That\'s simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months.', 'I agree hamas uses human shields and that they exacerbate the conditions to justify their hatred of jews. But also this could be handle with much less civilian qualities if the idf used spec ops, and used the mossad to go after the officials in Qatar.

I actually think I met more enby trans people than binary, too, so being trans is super accepted. plenty of trans faculty too (also enby as far as I know, based on pronouns alone. dont know of any out binary trans profs but that doesnt mean they dont exist).\n\nlots of UCSC policies to help protect LGBT+ people in general. worst case scenario, u reach out to faculty for an intervention (never heard of this needing to happen based on LGBT discrimination). most commonly, might need to let ur profs/peers know ur pronouns if ur misgendered. smaller classes usually have u introduce urself with pronouns tho so its a pretty uncommon occurrence. only time it happened to me, my professor apologized profusely before I even had the chance to talk to him about it lol.', 'Thanks for explaining!

Many of the assignments are time consuming and the assignment descriptions are pretty abstract sometimes so you need to be prepared to ask questions and work on it right when it comes out. I didn't go to sections as I fell behind but I've heard some others who got some good help on their assignments there.

They want to start coding at the last minute but they never took time to evaluate the problem so they get stuck. Or they took time to evaluate the problem and code it out, but no time to test it or look for bugs, so they turn in something that fails half the tests.  \n\n\nThe way you resolve this is by showing up to every class and every section. This will ensure you're picking up all the tips and tricks and hints that you can, it will also allow you to talk with TAs and professor during Office Hours which is a huge resource.  \n\n\nMake sure that you're reading your C book BEFORE class.

If you don't have the incentive to, just try to write for two minutes at the start of the week. If you figure out what to do, great! If not, go to the professor's office hours or a tutor's. \n- Consider reading the book.

People will ask and answer questions there, and the TAs are very active on it as well. This is probably the single most important feature that you should utilize in the class.

I’m a third year declared ECE student with a concentration in communication, signals and processing. I’m a little behind and the courses I want/need aren’t offered in the ideal order or quarter.

ECE 118 will absolutely take most of your time so like others have said you will most likely have to blow off 103.

Side note, it’s not the end of the world if you have to do one or two extra quarters. That’s a pretty common thing for ECE and robotic majors due to the high class load.']"

The room is not furnished — you will need to provide a bed, dresser, and desk if you want. There is an in-unit washer and dryer, along with a dishwasher. There are monthly utility bills including wifi, and the rent will be approximately $850 per month.

Bus stops for the 18 & 20 routes are within close walking distance, and Coastal Campus is within walking distance as well. No smoking (apartment complex rules). The apartment complex has a pool and gym that are free for us to use. The apartment complex name is Pacific Shores if you want to check out their website!

To quote him directly, me being in school is like “a chimp with a dab rig.” During our family Thanksgiving dinner today, he threw a tantrum in front of my family because he wanted to be the only dank farmer. He wants to be the pride of the family. “Cabrillo, for Christ’s sake?” He yelled at me as I asked my mom to pass the mashed potatoes. “What a sick joke. I worked my ass off to get where I am!

I'm coming in next fall so i know the first year as a junior transfer housing if guaranteed. I was wondering how difficult it would be to get housing for my senior year as well?

I'm not picky as far as where the room would be, or if its a single double triple etc. I'm also open to on campus apartments but I'll only be 22 my senior year.

Education : Bachelor (GPA 7.8/10) and Master (9.7/10) in Mechanical Engineering  
College : Indian Institute of Technology (One of top 4 colleges in India)  
SOP : Better than average (already reviewed)  
TOEFL : Above threshold

***Dilemma***

My education was in Mechanical Engg but my experience is in CS (as I liked it). Do you think I have a admit chance in your university?

Is it possible to share the stats for acceptance rate and placement rate in MS in CS? It would be super helpful :)

Thanks a lot

I've heard good things about the Dell XPS, but I've also heard that Apple products are better, is there any Comp Engineer majors that can help give me a suggestion? Thanks!","[""XPS is solid if you want to splurge. Framework might be worth looking into as well since you'd probably be interested in that sort of thing. HPs are good on the cheaper end. Lenovo will also often have class leading specs for the price range. Something running AMD silicon would probably be best as they tend to be more efficient than Intel machines. Ryzen 5 should be more than enough power to do anything you'll need it to, and performance wise, it should last longer than your degree will take to complete. Avoid Apple devices as their processors tend to have issues with virtual machines and some of the other software we use. Nothing with less than 16gb of ram, and ideally 32gb or more. You shouldn't need a GPU for anything unless you take any machine learning classes as an elective, and even then, i'm not sure if it would be necessary. I'd recommend getting something around 16 inches as the extra screen space will help your workflow. Storage will depend on whether you have any other computers or not. I use Dropbox so I don't save anything locally. If you are planning on using it as your only device, I'd recommend 1tb to be comfortable. If you have a desktop or some other way of storing files, then you can get away with 250-500gb. Anything more is unnecessary.\n\nI'm running an older HP envy that I picked up used for $300 on Marketplace because its last owner spilled coffee on it.

>**METRO Serves Rising Transit Demand at UCSC with Additional Extra Long Buses**  
>  
>METRO has secured a fleet of 12 extra-long, articulated buses to meet surging transit demand at the UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus. There are currently four, 60-foot articulated buses serving the campus with six more expected to be put into service by the end of 2023 and two in reserve.   
>  
>UCSC riders constitute almost 70% of METRO’s total ridership systemwide. At the start of the 2023 fall term, METRO carried an average of 13,409 UCSC riders per day. This compares to 10,349 average daily UCSC riders in September 2022, a leap of almost 30%.   
>  
>To address the rising demand on campus, METRO struck an agreement with the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) to purchase ten 60-foot articulated buses to augment the two METRO-owned articulated buses already serving the campus. Two of the ten MTS buses were put into service during the second week of the school year with another three more expected to arrive and begin serving the campus within the next two weeks. METRO expects to receive a total of ten articulated buses from MTS by the end of 2023.   
>  
>“UCSC students, faculty, and staff are our largest population of riders and we appreciate their commitment to environmentally friendly transportation,” said METRO Board Chair, Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson “That’s why it was so important for METRO to act quickly to secure more fleet capacity and ensure everyone who wants to ride the bus has a chance to do so.”   
>  
>An articulated bus can accommodate 60-65 seated passengers with room for an additional 15-25 standing passengers while a traditional 40-foot bus can carry 36 seated passengers with an additional 10-15 standees, depending on the make and model of the bus.   
>  
>METRO’s articulated buses will be wrapped with iconic images of Monterey Bay wildlife, such as sea lions, kelp forests, and sea jellies, as part of METRO’s One Ride at a Time campaign (ORAT). ORAT is a key element of METRO’s efforts to be an environmentally focused community partner in Santa Cruz County. ORAT gives riders the opportunity to protect the Monterey Bay’s extraordinary natural resources just by simply riding the bus. Thanks to ORAT, every ride on a METRO bus contributes to our partners in protecting the environment, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Foundation and the Bay of Life Fund.

So i'm thinking about transferring in for next fall into the games and playable media BA (art side of things) and i wanted to know opinions about the school for anyone who has maybe taken this major or knows of people. I also just wanted to now how people feel about the school.

Lastly if i did decide to go, I know porter is usually the college for transfers but in general what college would likely be the best to affiliate with for my chosen major?

Thanks so much! ","['Porter', 'i would say the only thing that college affiliation actually matters is for getting your sticker for your ID card, mail (if the place you are living at doesn’t have a mail room e.g. the village), as well as housing for the next year(i’m affiliated with college nine so i was able to sign up for housing with there with a lil priority but not much).', 'Porter is the lib arts college, it’s where the art history and visual culture dept is located. And even though I did transfer there- I truly loved living in the dorms there.', ""Know that it's a relatively new degree after a department reorganization, so the degree hasn't been tested. CS GD had a lot of prestige with it, and I think they were trying to move that prestige to multiple degrees. How successful they were? I don't know. If you were going to get a BA anyway, it won't hurt you. Just don't expect a job at Bethesda or Hasbro.\n\nAs to the school, I'd go if you like the outdoors or enjoy some Hippish counterculture vibes. Or you want the residential college system. Otherwise, you can go to any UC and be fine. SC used to be in the middle of the pack, but now it's towards the bottom, if not the bottom, for the UCs. The COL is on point for Berkeley, but the quality of life is lower. So again, UCSC is not a bad school, but it doesn't seem like things like housing are getting better soon and if you have the option for other us, I'd go for it."", 'Hey! AGPM and art student here. UCSC’s AGPM major is one of the best game design majors offered by a public school in the country, and *the* best in California. I personally love it, but because it’s so new it changes curriculums pretty routinely. Since switching affiliation from CS to the Arts, it’s become a lot more art-focused and we are no longer required to take STEM courses or collaborate with CS majors for our thesis projects.\n\nThe foundational courses are entertaining and fun, but are also a LOT of theory. It’s not hard, but there is little to no objectivity besides the psychology around games, which you learn in your required lower-division courses. A but of a warning, though, many of the upper-division art courses that are important to the game design industry (like 3D modeling) are restricted to Art majors ONLY. It’s why I’m double-majoring, so I would think about that!\n\nAs for college affiliation, it really doesn’t matter. You’re right about Porter having a large transfer community, but it’s also the “art” college. I think you’d be a good fit for Porter if you went there. However, Merrill (my affiliation) is often concerned with humanities and global consciousness and I’ve never had an issue making friends also in the arts despite it. The only thing affiliation matters for is choosing roommates for on-campus housing (you and your prospective roommates have to share an affiliation in order for you to request them) and the Core classes. However, transfers don’t have to take Core.\n\nThe other comment mentions CSGD, but that program has fallen off recently from what I’ve heard from those in the department. UCSC is also a wonderful school with the only major issue being the housing crisis. Please don’t let that discourage you, though. This school is amazing at giving students benefits and resources, and you’re also guaranteed housing as a first-year transfer. It is ranked low on most college-ranking websites, but that’s often because UCSC doesn’t have many celebrity alumni nor one big major everyone’s gunning for. \n\nI’d say you’re making the right choice in terms of AGPM/game design if you choose to come to UCSC for it. Hope this helps!', ""Thank you so much! This is very helpful :) I didn't know anything about them restricting certain art courses like that..

You’ll still go into AGPM as a proposed major. Once you get into UCSC, you’ll talk to your advisor about proposing in the second major. In your case, I’d recommend double-majoring in Art (like I am).

Last week, I lost my sister, and school has been the last thing on my mind. Right now I'm trying to sort out my grades and figure out what's salvageable and I am considering taking a break in the winter quarter to be with family. I have strong grades in three out of four classes, but my grade in chem lab is a bit shaky. I missed a lab day a few weeks ago, when thought I had the flu. I'm far from failing but I do have a high(ish) C that I was pretty sure I'd be able to pull to a B, but will several deadlines missed last week I'm not sure how my professor will react. I was wondering how best to communicate my situation to my professors, especially in the one class I could have done better in.

I'm not trying to raise any grades at this point or earn any pity points I just want to be able to get to winter break and not have all these weeks of work go in total waste. I've been staring at an empty email screen, not sure where to start. If you have any suggestions, they would be much appreciated.

Despite this, I decided to go easy on the courseload this semester in anticipation of the class being hard. I decided to take CSE 130 and two easy GEs.  


People were lying. CSE 130 is easily the hardest class I've ever taken. The first PA took me forty hours of actively working - I use Pomodoro to keep myself focused. I go to every single tutor and ta office hour I can. I work to the point where I'm sleeping less than three hours a night and I still manage to finish late. I don't understand how this class is supposed to be humanly possible.  


If you think the PAs are hard, don't even get me started on the midterms. The first midterm, I studied for a least a week before and I show up day of and understand none of the questions. The test might as well have been written in German. I show up to every single lecture and sit in the front row - and yet I recognized none of the terms EVEN AFTER STUDYING FOR A WEEK. I literally left after thirty minutes after I submitted a blank sheet.  


For the second midterm, I studied for two weeks coming up to it. I talked to the professor after class to try and get clarification on the material and in general put a lot more effort than I normally do. My social life suffered immensely from my struggle to succeed in this class. Despite this, we had the midterm today and it went awful. I knew two of the multiple choice questions and the rest were ancient egyptian to me. Don't even get me started on the FRQ section. I used to be a TS fan but now I despise her.   


At this point, I don't have a lot of options. I'm planning dropping out of UCSC as soon as I can. Thanks to all the friends that tried to help me with understanding CS. Maybe in another life I'd have a better shot.","['Yeah Upper Div CS classes are weird sometimes they click and you can just naturally grasp and comprehend material better and other times they are just unbearably difficult to comprehend. Talk to your professor about your position in the class and see if it’s possible for you to pass. Careers aren’t based on you being able to understand every concept of every class you took. Most of the classes you take you will never need. Don’t get discouraged. Your feelings are valid, but sometimes in the heat of the moment emotions can cloud rational thought. I would recommend getting a good night of rest and trying to rationalize the choices you want to make regarding your future.', 'Thanks for the support :)', 'Drop out for just one class??  You survived all the lower-division, with 16, 13S, 12, 101, 30 (in random order), and now you want to drop because ONE upper div you find it hard? \n\nHang on best you can.  Then take other upper divs to build stronger background, and try again.  You can also study the subject on books on your own in preparation for taking it again. Not everything works on the first try.', ""I don't think I'm cut out to be a CS major. I primarily joined the field because my parents wanted to but I think I'm much more of a math kind of gal. Maybe I'll switch majors instead of dropping out. Would it still be possible for me to get a CS minor? It would be a shame to have wasted two years completely."", ""The minor requires all the lower divs, CSE101, 2 Upper Division electives, and 2 'breadth courses'  from a select list.

The students that are struggling aren't going to be posting on reddit/discord saying that they are drowning in work.

I would stick with it and see how the class ends up before making any crazy decisions. If others are struggling in the class as well the professor is likely to offer extra credit or a curve towards the end of the quarter. One nice thing about UCSC is that if you do happen to fail, you can retake the class and overwrite the grade. This pushes you back slightly, but is really not as bad as people think.

So many choices..."", 'What’s the average starting salary out of college?', 'For CS, I believe the average is around 70k - 100k depending on the location. However, the market is oversaturated with CS majors right now and the market is doing poorly because it is going through a correction from all the hiring during covid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther majors I would prob say 30k-60k if its not CS or engineer related', 'Thanks for the reply. Seems like everyone is trying to get a CS degree.', 'Graduated with a BS in CS back in 2021, failed CSE 130 the first time I took it. I will say though, that it was the hardest class I took at UCSC (except maybe CSE 138). Things clicked and I got past it the second time I took it. You will not struggle nearly as much with other upper divs. I would not recommend giving up on CS yet.', 'Is everyone talking about Quinn’s offering of the class or veenstra or both? Is one more difficult than the other?', 'Have you ever heard of the strategy where you add an item to your Amazon cart but wait 2-3 weeks until you buy it to see if you really need it or if its just a impromtu buy?\n\nIn the same way maybe you can take a step back, finish the course best you can, and then think about your choice to drop out, change majors, or whatever then? Maybe you decide NO! I don\'t want to do this!. So be it, but perhaps its better to spend such energy deciding that when you are out of your ""impromptu buy"" zone?\n\nSome other points to consider:\n\n1. Perhaps there is a disconnect from what you are studying/taught at lectures and what is on the test? Perhaps if you took a different approach in trying to first ask yourself a) what will be on the test, then working backwards from there you would do better? For example I took multivariable calc, and in the lectures there was some not-so-clear to me math logic stuff,..... **but** if I rmb correctly the test had mostly, if not all, algebra number type problems, not theory problems,.... so the smart thing to do for my grade would be to forget about the lecture theory stuff and focus on the algebra....It seems like you mentioned a similar thing ""I recognized none of the terms"". Maybe what is taught in lecture is different from what is on the test?\n2. Can you find some people in your class who are doing well? Can you ask them what they do and try to copy their formula/approach? Or a TA who has taken the class before? Perhaps they would study something different than you are?\n3. There might be a  disconnect between what you learn at school and what you will use on the job (depending on what you do). For exmaple, you might learn assembly language,..... but do you think most companies hire engineers to code in assembly? So rather than thinking ""i\'m not cut out for cs"" on the basis of one class, perhaps take a bigger picture look regarding the relationship between your classes, your degree, and potential jobs for you post grad, and how they might not be as closely related as you might think.\n4.

Is lack of sleep or stress affecting your logical/cognitive mind capabilities making this class harder than it needs to be?', 'I remember I took this class with a horrible professor and it was just an awful experience except the TA was amazing and basically taught the class.

180b9yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/180b9yo/help_with_grades/,2023-11-20 23:16:41,Help with grades,"So, for context, I caught covid and for about 3 sessions I needed to miss a geology lab. While I was negative, I still had hefty post-covid symptoms and I had not yet gotten my prescription inhaler. The problem arises with the time frame for this course- it was at night. Walking home with no inhaler with asthma and post covid symptoms is basically a death sentence for my respiratory system. When I finally got my inhaler, I returned to class where the teacher told me I had 1 week to make up basically 3 weeks worth of work. I've emailed them a bunch and they aren't exactly responsive when I attempt to contact them, so I'm trying to see what the worst case scenario is.

If I submit my work and at worst get a 65% on them, I'd end the class with around a 72% in the class. Is that considered failing by ucsc standards? Will I still get credit for the class?

1. Lower Div classes are considerably easier than Upper Divs. (Not Including weeder classes)
2. Upper Div classes are more interesting than the Lower Divs
3. Interesting upper div classes with good professors can be hard to get into because:
   1. Everybody wants them so they get filled up quickly
   2. They may be offered infrequently depending on the department for the class, especially if you want to take it with a specific professor

Thus:

* Pros:

1. If there was a best time to take 4 classes at once it would be in your under-divs where all the classes are easier.
2. Taking more classes in your freshmen year gets you ahead on the curriculum, this means that you get to the more interesting classes quicker than if you didn't.
3. Getting ahead in your classes opens up your opportunities:
   1. Graduate early
   2. Double &/or Minor
   3. Don't have to worry about not getting all your classes done in time to graduate in 4 yrs
   4. Take more upper divs & electives that you are interested in taking
4. Getting ahead of your peers in the same school year gives you better priority than them. Usually, students in the same year go for the same classes, this will give you a better pick than them and a higher likely hood getting into these interesting classes with good professors.
5. If you are able to obtain senior standing ahead of being senior not only do you have the priority of a senior when picking classes (which is the highest without doing a special program like sports or an honors group), but you also can choose 3 classes in your first pass instead of 2!

* Cons:

1. Taking four classes takes up more of your weekly time to join clubs, hang out with and make new friends, go to parties, do other extracurriculars, have personal time, etc.
2. Taking four classes might be too hard for you if you are already finding it hard to do three. Everyone learns at their own pace, and it's possible that three classes are already hitting that sweet spot for you where if you take any more it'll be too much.

Caveat: Of course, this depends on your classes. Some are harder/easier than others, and I would suggest strategizing by looking at your department's tentative class schedule for the school year to plan ahead and your courses.

Conclusion:

Taking 4 classes in your Freshman and Sophomore year doing your Under-Divs can have very significant benefits. However, you still may find it unfavorable depending on how much you value its Pros vs. its Cons. It's definitely totally valid to not take 4 classes per quarter for your under-divs, but it can be an enticing option if you feel like your current course load of 3 a quarter is an easy-moderate difficulty that I would suggest you consider.

I use the app at least once a week and always make sure they bikes are locked when returning. 

Contacted Bcycle and they said to expect an email within 48hrs. I don’t understand how they can charge someone $3k without contacting them before to explain/ask questions?! I checked my history and made sure that every checkout has a recorded drop off receipt with it. So I don’t understand what’s going on.

Has anyone else had this issue?

Edit: Update for everyone. I visited Bcycles Santa Cruz hq and spoke to the manager. Three weeks ago one of my bcycles wouldn’t dock properly, the bike locked into the dock without beeping or sending me a notification that my trip had ended. I proceeded to contact support and virtually verified the drop off with a picture. Turns out somebody jacked the bike right after and stripped it for parts. They found the frame yesterday, (some of you probably saw another redditor post about it) and charged me once they made the connection.

Upon speaking to the manager, he was adamant that I am liable considering I was the last person to unlock the bike. Once I showed him the text receipts he softened up a bit and agreed to reach out to their corporate HQ. 10 min after he sent me home, he called me back with an apology and promise to refund. Definitely a whirlwind of emotions right for about 20 min right there.

I choose to do CS to get into cybersecurity and yet CSE132 (the very class about cybersecurity) isn't recognized as an elective course for a computer science major. There are many more examples of this within the catalog, why is this? If I wanted to do game design courses for my major... I would've chosen a game design major. There are tons of super cool CS courses that I would love to take, but it seems that I would be wasting time, money and effort if they don't count towards my degree.(not that game design isn't technical, just that I would much rather take classes that would later help in the industry I want to get involved in).

Is CSE101 a good one to take as well? plenty of my friends will be taking that next quarter.

The class teaches everything you need to know about these technologies through lectures and plenty of example and starter code. You should also definitely utilize professor Harrison's office hours as he provides great insight into the assignments and software paradigms in general. I also highly recommend taking CSE187 if you have the chance. The sole prereq for that class is CSE186. In the class, you develop a full stack application with a team. You also learn NextJS, GraphQL, and developing web apps in a microservice-oriented architecture as opposed to traditional monolithic applications developed in CSE186. From what I heard, CSE183 uses Vue.js and Py4Web. The stack in CSE186 and CSE187 is more cutting edge and I find that more jobs/companies have that stack listed in their job descriptions."", 'I took cse 101 & 140. 140 was really enjoyable, but I think now theyre might be a new pre req for it?

Nevertheless, as I’m crying and on the phone with my mom, an older student noticed me having a breakdown outside of the bookstore and was so kind to me. He lended me cash (don’t worry, of course I venmoed him right away) and told me that everything was going to be okay :’) His name was Angel too, so if you’re reading this you really made an impact on me that day.

Professors incentives are just not set up to encourage teaching quality as a criteria of their employment.  Unless you want to be involved in undergrad research (and you have to work for it!

If you're interested in a topic that UCSC does well, and are interested in the research coming out of a particular lab, then of course the above advice doesn't really apply.

I was also on the Dean's list for both semesters of my freshmen year, which hopefully helps a little bit. If I finish business law with an A then I'll have a 3.75 major GPA which I heard is supposed to help, as colleges often put more weight into how you did in your major classes.

I know I made the mistake of not signing up for TAG, I initially was not considering UCSC but changed my mind from going out of state because not all of my courses would transfer. But since you only need a 3.0 GPA to qualify I figured my chances would be solid anyways with a 3.2 GPA, especially with almost all A's from my business courses. Also I am on pace for 60 units so that won't be an issue either. I am a little nervous that I could still end up getting rejected since UCs aren't the easiest schools to get into.
