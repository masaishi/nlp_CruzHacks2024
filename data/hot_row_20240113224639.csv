Not unless you give them $1,412/mo FOREVER"", ""IMO UC Santa Cruz striking graduate students who were fired were being unreasonable, and will regret being fired later.\n\nFirst of all, they were in the middle of a 4 year contract that their union voted on and ratified, and their strike was not sanctioned by their union.\n\nSecond, they were paid $2,434 monthly for their part time/ 20 hour a week Teaching Assistant positions (about $30 per hour). They wanted an increase of $1,412 monthly. That is a 58% increase, pretty pie in the sky for any job.\n\nThird, they were getting their tuition and healthcare paid for, also a signing bonus, and UCSC offered an additional $2,500 during the strike. Taken together, this is about 30-40k of additional compensation they were receiving. They also, of course, would get a degree out of it. So conservatively, they were earning about $50,000 per year for their 20 hour a week teaching jobs while getting a degree. Keep in mind that their jobs and classes were only 9 month out the year as well, so they had an additional 3 months to earn other income from other jobs.\n\nFourth, many graduate programs in other professions require you to pay for your tuition and health insurance. Ask any lawyer, physician, RN, pharmacist, social worker, MBA, physical therapist, CPA, architect to name a few. Many graduate studies require people to work part time or full time jobs and in most of these programs students generally go into debt.\n\nFifth, the undergraduate students who paid to be at UCSC were unable to get their grades for months. To make it even worse, strikes included actually disturbing students while taking midterms.\n\nI cannot comprehend how anyone could think it was worth it to loose all of their compensation and their graduate degree over roughly $12,000 per year (their requested increase). My bet is most will regret their decision to loose their degree over a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, I am not saying they don't have the right to strike. They can strike, fight for whatever they want, no matter how unreasonable. I am just saying this seems like poor decision making, and now that they are out of their jobs, they are going to have a hard time finding anything even remotely as well paying, not to mention the lost future earnings of not earning their degree.\n\nPlease let me know if I have made any factual mistakes or if you actually have responses to these arguments, when I have tried to present this info. in the past I was downvoted, but no one ever bothered to even try to argue a different position and/or their arguments were made in bad faith.

I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n\n4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n\nMoreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n\n5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n\n6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n\nHowever, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n\nSo yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n\n7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n\n8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n\n9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n\nYou also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n\n10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."", 'I think you\'re looking at the trees and not seeing the forest. If you take a step back it\'s easy to see that COLA is a bandaid on a bullet hole. The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they\'re asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. \n\nPlus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don\'t run out of money and aren\'t forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That\'s a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.\n\nI hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending.', 'You\'re right that COLA doesn\'t fix the underlying systemic issues.

Long term solutions that don\'t support grads in the short term aren\'t viable solutions.\n\nI\'m not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can\'t be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council\'s hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.\n\nThere\'s a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn\'t solely the city\'s fault, but also a result of the university\'s unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). \n\nBut somehow, I don\'t think any of that really matters to you.

Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. \n\nYou're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union.

To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault. It's ironic that in the same sentence that you would condemn me for calling you dishonest, you manage to misrepresent what I said.\n\nYour comparison between strikers and anti-immigration advocates relies on nothing but surface level similarities and ignores the underlying philosophical and ideological differences that structure those arguments. It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. \n\nIt is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."", '[deleted]', 'I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". \n\nI said it was dishonest to claim that the university\'s refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument?

Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be.

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? \n\n3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n\n4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n\nMoreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n\n5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n\n6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n\nHowever, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n\nSo yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n\n7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n\n8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n\n9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n\nYou also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n\n10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."", 'I think you\'re looking at the trees and not seeing the forest. If you take a step back it\'s easy to see that COLA is a bandaid on a bullet hole. The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they\'re asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. \n\nPlus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don\'t run out of money and aren\'t forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That\'s a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.\n\nI hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending.', 'You\'re right that COLA doesn\'t fix the underlying systemic issues.

Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades.

Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council\'s hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.\n\nThere\'s a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn\'t solely the city\'s fault, but also a result of the university\'s unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). \n\nBut somehow, I don\'t think any of that really matters to you.

Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. \n\nYou're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem.

You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates.""

By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement.

I think it\'s pretty clear why the administration won\'t talk to strikers: the Union won\'t let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you\'re attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That\'s less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I\'m not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.', 'The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault.

It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. \n\nIt is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."", '[deleted]', 'I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". \n\nI said it was dishonest to claim that the university\'s refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong?

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don\'t fund their students. That doesn\'t change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I\'m honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn\'t fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don\'t have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor\'s told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don\'t want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here\'s some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don\'t think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn\'t mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that\'s defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it\'s not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I\'d also add that strikers aren\'t against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don\'t have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it\'s student base, no one would be complaining, but that\'s not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I\'m still left wondering how you plan to do that. It\'s easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I\'ve seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven\'t people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term.', '[deleted]', ""I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault.

Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be.

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education.

One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don\'t include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren\'t taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there\'s some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I\'m not sure what it would be. I\'d actually describe it more as a coupon.\n\nYou might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I\'ve described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you\'d like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.\n\ntl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it\'s not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad', ""Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.\n\nAlso, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."", ""This is informative, thank you.

You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I\'m not sure you\'ve actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you\'ve just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That\'s fine, but it\'s rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I\'ve presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I\'d reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity.', ""Me: The faculty senate passed the measure with 78% of the vote.\nYou: Yeah but some of those faculty are from departments I don't like."", 'Yeah I’ll go with that.
