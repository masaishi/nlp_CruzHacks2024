1. The Listing Has No Photos
2. They Want Your Personal Information before you see the property
3. The Email Address or Domain Looks Fishy
4. Beautiful Home or Unit for super cheap
5. Any wire-transfer at any time
6. Credit check before seeing the property 
7. Owner Is out of Town"

h91v52j,o7c6mz,2021-08-15 10:09:45,"Hey, I was an RA and Student Housing Manager for 3 years and our LGBTQ floors never filled up anywhere on campus. We usually had about 80% students who requested it, and 20% who were placed there because we needed the space to be used. You probably didn't get put in because you forgot to include your birth gender. That happens all the time and it would be inappropriate for someone to assume that you would want to be on the LGBTQ floor since a majority of the LGBTQ population actually don't request to be put on LGBTQ housing. 

The themes for the floor really don't affect your living all that much, unless you are on one of the floors for sensitive smells and such."

hkjzhvm,o7c6mz,2021-11-13 21:52:49,Bro tuition itself is more expensive at Notre Dame. Also networking here is far superior for the tech industry which is what I am doing so yeah maybe for you but again people have a lot of differing priorities so saying almost anything definitive about college is difficult because by doing so you are assuming someone has the same values that you do.

Hi everyone! We are looking to fill two spots (female-identifying only) in our house which is about a 10 minute walk to downtown, and about the same time to 2 different bus stops (10 and 15)! We are 420 and alcohol friendly but we maintain a studious household. We are very friendly and keep it a low stress environment where everyone gets along. One spot is in the master triple, it would start around Aug/Sept and rent is $685 per month plus utilities (PG&E and wifi) around $30 per month. The other spot is in the double: it starts July 1st and rent is $729 with utilities around $30 per month. Pm me for more info!"

Thanks."
h8hghzz,o7c6mz,2021-08-10 18:47:45,"Same situation, after talking with people from the housing office, tl;dr is ""don't count on it."" They said they don't expect to give spots to many waitlist people (and the fact that they won't even touch the waitlist till early-mid august should give it away), so i was encouraged to find off-campus housing in the meantime. You don't have to drop your application though, there's only a cancellation fee once you already have signed a housing contract (IE you have locked in an on-campus room) so you can look for off-campus stuff until then. On that note, since we're in the same boat, if you're interested we can PM and maybe try to find something to rent split together? I'm a fourth year biochem/molecular bio major and having someone to split rent with (shared single room or 2 bedroom, tbh I can't be picky) would help widen options."
h3n9bm5,o7c6mz,2021-06-30 21:12:36,Is this in the housing portal? Do you have priority? Mine doesn't have anything on the status of my app (soph w/o priority)

h3q7p67,o7c6mz,2021-07-01 14:00:51,So if I don't have anything on the housing portal about my app status I'm probably not going to get anything? The portal says assignments are emailed in late August so I don't know if I should start looking elsewhere

I am a 24 y/o 5th year transfer student coming from SoCal and moving to Santa Cruz for the first time ever. I am a neuroscience major, so as a STEM major I spend the majority of my time studying. I'm a very laid-back guy and easy to get along with. I also enjoy staying active, cooking, listening to music and simply hanging out with good company. I may seem quiet at first but if you get to know me I'm sure we could be great friends. 

I am looking for something simple: A single room, but at this point I am very open to a double or even a triple. Also my budget is $800-$1200, always negotiable. My current income is about $1000+ as a restaurant server (base pay+tips), and for the past year I've put about 50%-80% of each check into a savings strictly for paying future rent when I move out. 

If you have a room available, or in the same shoes as I am please pm so we could get in contact. Thank you"

hnxjotr,o7c6mz,2021-12-09 17:53:29,"Hey! I’m Derek, and I’m a sophomore at UCSC.

• I’m looking for a room for the winter and spring 2022 quarters near campus.
• I would prefer my own room, and it doesn’t have to be anything fancy; I just need four walls.
• My budget is around $800–1,100 (flexible).

• By default and as someone who’s more introverted than not, I keep to myself a lot, but I can definitely still participate in the occasional conversation and activity.
• I clean up after myself; am hygienic; and try to be as communicative, considerate, and civil as I can be.
• I don’t use any substances, I have no pets, I don’t party, and I make little noise.

• My ideal roommate is someone who either understands and/or mirrors some of my traits (some cleanliness, communication, and civility).
• I don’t mind if you drink/smoke, have a pet, like to invite friends over, or make noise, as long as boundaries are respected when they’re set.

• I’m hoping to move in some time before the winter quarter starts.
• Please let me know if you’re interested in rooming with me!
• Even if some of these standards don’t lie within yours, still feel free to message me, and we can talk about it! I don’t want to be too much of a choosing beggar.

Some extra information about me:
• I am not currently employed.
• I am not allergic to anything, and I currently do not have any sort of restricted diet.
• My sleep schedule sometimes wavers, but I try to be considerate as I can be, and I don’t really make much loud noise anyway.
• I’m declared as a Psych major with a minor in Education.
• I watch a lot of Survivor and Big Brother, so if you want to have conversations about that, I’m down.
• I’m also really open to listening to new music (I’ve listened to nearly 500 albums since last year), watching new stuff, and playing video games (I only play Minecraft and Roblox though so 😮‍💨) so I’d be down for recommendations."

jkyc3cc,o7c6mz,2023-05-20 14:37:08,"Hey!

I'm on the lookout for a roommate to share a large attic room in a house near the base of campus. There are seven roommates in the house, including me, and we're all either CS:CGD or AGPM majors (and I'm both). We're a bit more than just roommates, though — we like to share meals, game, and hang out together from time to time.

My preferred roommate would be a male-identifying CS:CGD or AGPM major who fits in well in our little community. I'm seeking someone with solid personal hygiene habits and a non-smoking policy, at least within our shared space. You should be on the quieter side, friendly, easy-going, and mostly tidy.

We’re a stone's throw from the main entrance of UCSC. The closest city bus stop at Bay St and Escalona is just a 5-minute stroll away, and the base of campus loop shuttle stop is a doable 20-minute walk. We've got laundry covered with an in-house washer and dryer. The rent for the room is $1300 per month. Utilities are extra, usually around $75-$80 each month.

I think this setup could be a great match for the right person, offering not just a roof over your head, but a warm and friendly community vibe, too. If this sounds like a good fit for you or you've got any questions, shoot me a DM."

However, the counteroffer I received for on-campus housing got sent to my school email’s JUNK a few days ago. I didn’t see this until yesterday, so my priority is now void and I’m low-key freaking out. As a result, I am now last-minute searching for off campus housing. If anyone is possibly in the same boat, or maybe a transfer looking for off-campus housing, hmu and we could potentially be roommates. I’m looking to spend roughly $1500 a month (flexible to an extent). If you have an open spot in a group, I am all ears, otherwise I’ve had my eyes on maybe finding some people to rent out a three bedroom house or something the like (I really just need some buddies to plan out a place to live). I’m not really a party person, but my only real requirement is that I need somewhere to put my car. 

If there’s any advice out there for my situation, I’d also appreciate that too. I’m pretty sure housing decisions were supposed to be released today, and I’ve still got nothing on my housing portal so I’m just gonna assume I didn’t get anything. I just don’t understand why they would send the housing emails to only the ucsc account, which by default throws it into the junk mailbox.


EDIT: THEY STILL ACCEPTED ME ACCEPTING THE OFFER LATER LET’S GOOOOOOO!!! Hoping anyone that has had similar issues the best!"

Hey All,

We have a large single on the West side open for $1200 per month and looking for the perfect fit.

A bit about us and the house:

\- 2 males both 22 years old, but will totally consider female-identifying+

\- the house is a 3 bed 1 bath, the room for rent is the master bedroom

\- Ideally we are looking for a 4th year (or older), but will consider younger people too

\- we are both math / CS inclined and work in the field, you don't have to be too but worth mentioning

\- semi-musical house, musically inclined is a plus

\- active house, surfing / mountain biking / skating / foraging / passion for nature etc. is a plus

\- 420 friendly

\- artistically inclined is a plus

\- would prefer no pets, but exceptions could be made

If you're interested, please respond with a blurb about yourself, what makes you interesting and what you're looking for in a house.

Thanks!

It is a 10-minute walk from Shopper's Corner, a 5-minute walk from Trader Joe's, a 10-minute walk from the rest of downtown, and a 15-minute walk to the Santa Cruz Metro Center with buses to campus. Driving time to Science Hill is about 20 minutes. This situation would be a good deal for visiting scholars or other temporary residents of Santa Cruz.

As for me, I’m a 4th year Language Studies student with a concentration in Japanese. I’m a pretty laid back guy who likes to cook, workout, clean, listen to music, and I’m into fashion. Please PM if you’re interested, thank you!!"

hvmyubo,o7c6mz,2022-02-04 16:42:45,"Hi Everyone! 

I have a room available starting April 15th (or a little earlier).
The house is located right next to West Cliff and is a 5 minute walk to the beach and 8-10 minute walk to bus stops (bus 19 or 20).

The sublease would be until August 2022 but my roommates are staying there for another academic year so you can renew the lease with them for the next academic year if you would like to and if you feel like it’s a good match :) 

A bit about the roomies:
They’re both male CS majors and are older transfer students. They’re both kind, respectful and chill and are big gamers (one is going into game design) We are looking for someone that would respect each other’s space and that is responsible. 

A bit about the space: 
You will have your own room that comes with a small closet and you also have your own bathroom :) there’s plenty of space to park your bike inside, and other storage space if needed. 

Costs:
1,500 per month + ~100 bucks for utilities (give or take $20) internet is free until august, however, if you renew the lease, you will have to add that to the utility bill. 

Please DM me if you have any questions. 
The listing is also on places4students under student sublease so you can reach me there too."

We are two seniors at UCSC looking for a third housemate, since our third one got on campus housing, one CS and one Business majors. You would be sharing a living room with the housemate majoring in business. The setup can be modified to fit your privacy needs. It is larger than any of the large triples found on both UCSC and Cabrillo College, which includes a balcony. The property manager requires a $500 refundable deposit fee, and it will be refunded upon moving out. The washer and dryers are available in a separate unit with a padlock preventing public use. Although pets are allowed in the apartment complex, we do not want any and therefore will not allow any. Regarding the parking, there is a parking spot that can be shared; otherwise you can park in the residential area across the street (Wrinkle Ave).

j2oj5rl,o7c6mz,2023-01-02 13:22:35,"Cross post regarding relocation assistance.  In case anyone was unaware, if the landlord raises your rent to a large degree that you cannot afford (over 5% in a one year span, or over 7% in a 12-24 month span) and you are forced to move as a result, the landlord owes you two months of rent in order to relocate and find a new place.  *Edit: Legally cannot affect your deposit. *I have a question, but links to the laws are provided in this post:

Hey everyone, I am looking for a sublet (M) for a single room in a house with 7 housemates (M) who are mostly CS majors. The house is close to Natural Bridges and is a short walk from the 20 bus stop. The room is on the top floor of the house and gets lots of natural sunlight. It comes with a desk, dresser, a mirror, and a twin size bed. The bathroom is shared with a flatmate in the single next to the room. There is a kitchen, dining room, and a living room. You are a great fit if you are into game nights (Smash Bros and board games), video games in general, and gymming. That being said, none of those are requirements, so don’t worry!

* Rent: $965/month
* Security Deposit: $1000 (refunded at the end if no damages)

Hey all, I recently received an offer for a lease, but my original roommate  
backed out at the last minute, and I need to find someone quickly to take his  
place.   
The Lease is for 13 months but we will only be paying for 11 (June and December  
are free), Plus, they are offering $1500 off initial move-in costs.  
The lease will be from this May to next June. For a single the rent will  
come out to around $1950 plus utilities, which would result in a lifetime cost  
of around $20-21.5k.  
If you're looking for a double, the rent would be around $1100 plus  
utilities, which would result in a lifetime cost of around $11k-12.1k.  
I have to  
get back to the Landlord quickly so I’d like to get this filled as soon as  
possible. Preferably by the end of the week. Please feel free to contact me for

We usually had about 80% students who requested it, and 20% who were placed there because we needed the space to be used.

That happens all the time and it would be inappropriate for someone to assume that you would want to be on the LGBTQ floor since a majority of the LGBTQ population actually don't request to be put on LGBTQ housing.

They said they don't expect to give spots to many waitlist people (and the fact that they won't even touch the waitlist till early-mid august should give it away), so i was encouraged to find off-campus housing in the meantime. You don't have to drop your application though, there's only a cancellation fee once you already have signed a housing contract (IE you have locked in an on-campus room) so you can look for off-campus stuff until then. On that note, since we're in the same boat, if you're interested we can PM and maybe try to find something to rent split together? I'm a fourth year biochem/molecular bio major and having someone to split rent with (shared single room or 2 bedroom, tbh I can't be picky) would help widen options."

ibovccx,o7c6mz,2022-06-08 20:17:10,Hi thought I'd just respond to your comment to clear it up for others as well. The double only has one spot available meaning you would be rooming with one other person already. So the position is sadly not available for 2 new people but for 1 person. Hope that makes sense
ibow1xw,o7c6mz,2022-06-08 20:23:25,"Oh I see. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you for clarifying. Is there any possibility that you’d be interested in making it a triple? It has been really challenging to find a sublease in Santa Cruz for the summer and we have to start an internship soon this month. We would be willing to pay more for both of us and we would be out for most of the day since it’s a full-time. If you feel that is not possible, I understand."

Please dm!"
juocick,o7c6mz,2023-08-03 14:19:31,I DM'd you
jt51vyo,o7c6mz,2023-07-23 09:47:01,"The housing market is *rough*. You will definitely have to spend a lot of time looking for leads and jumping on them ASAP as you are competing with a lot of other people (including students like myself). I'm not a fan of Facebook but I made an account to access the Santa Cruz Housing group, there are plenty of people posting available rooms and subleases fairly frequently. And hey, if you find a place that needs three people I'm happy to apply with you lol."

hkjzhvm,o7c6mz,2021-11-13 21:52:49,Bro tuition itself is more expensive at Notre Dame. Also networking here is far superior for the tech industry which is what I am doing so yeah maybe for you but again people have a lot of differing priorities so saying almost anything definitive about college is difficult because by doing so you are assuming someone has the same values that you do.
jmablbd,o7c6mz,2023-05-30 19:13:50,What part of the ad did you not understand? What makes you think that you have the right to waste their time when they have stated their criteria?
jpki47w,o7c6mz,2023-06-26 02:26:07,i’m guessing bros comment was a joke lmao
h3q61xa,o7c6mz,2021-07-01 13:48:52,"It is the housing portal, and I do not have priority. I doubt that I'm going to get it, but I would much rather house on campus so I don't want to pull the plug too soon, but I don't want to go too late and scramble for housing either."
h3q7p67,o7c6mz,2021-07-01 14:00:51,So if I don't have anything on the housing portal about my app status I'm probably not going to get anything? The portal says assignments are emailed in late August so I don't know if I should start looking elsewhere

ibovccx,o7c6mz,2022-06-08 20:17:10,Hi thought I'd just respond to your comment to clear it up for others as well. The double only has one spot available meaning you would be rooming with one other person already. So the position is sadly not available for 2 new people but for 1 person. Hope that makes sense
ibow1xw,o7c6mz,2022-06-08 20:23:25,"Oh I see. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you for clarifying. Is there any possibility that you’d be interested in making it a triple? It has been really challenging to find a sublease in Santa Cruz for the summer and we have to start an internship soon this month. We would be willing to pay more for both of us and we would be out for most of the day since it’s a full-time. If you feel that is not possible, I understand."

fjejgky,fb815r,2020-03-03 14:00:39,"IMO UC Santa Cruz striking graduate students who were fired were being unreasonable, and will regret being fired later.

First of all, they were in the middle of a 4 year contract that their union voted on and ratified, and their strike was not sanctioned by their union.

Second, they were paid $2,434 monthly for their part time/ 20 hour a week Teaching Assistant positions (about $30 per hour). They wanted an increase of $1,412 monthly. That is a 58% increase, pretty pie in the sky for any job.

Third, they were getting their tuition and healthcare paid for, also a signing bonus, and UCSC offered an additional $2,500 during the strike. Taken together, this is about 30-40k of additional compensation they were receiving. They also, of course, would get a degree out of it. So conservatively, they were earning about $50,000 per year for their 20 hour a week teaching jobs while getting a degree. Keep in mind that their jobs and classes were only 9 month out the year as well, so they had an additional 3 months to earn other income from other jobs.

Fourth, many graduate programs in other professions require you to pay for your tuition and health insurance. Ask any lawyer, physician, RN, pharmacist, social worker, MBA, physical therapist, CPA, architect to name a few. Many graduate studies require people to work part time or full time jobs and in most of these programs students generally go into debt.

Fifth, the undergraduate students who paid to be at UCSC were unable to get their grades for months. To make it even worse, strikes included actually disturbing students while taking midterms.

I cannot comprehend how anyone could think it was worth it to loose all of their compensation and their graduate degree over roughly $12,000 per year (their requested increase). My bet is most will regret their decision to loose their degree over a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, I am not saying they don't have the right to strike. They can strike, fight for whatever they want, no matter how unreasonable. I am just saying this seems like poor decision making, and now that they are out of their jobs, they are going to have a hard time finding anything even remotely as well paying, not to mention the lost future earnings of not earning their degree.

Please let me know if I have made any factual mistakes or if you actually have responses to these arguments, when I have tried to present this info. in the past I was downvoted, but no one ever bothered to even try to argue a different position and/or their arguments were made in bad faith. If you need background info., you can read here : [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/university-of-california-student-strike-fired](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/university-of-california-student-strike-fired)"
fj4g24h,fb815r,2020-02-29 12:17:07,"Genuinely curious on these:

1. Why do some grad students receive a stipend for a 12-month period and others for a 9-month period only? What’s the difference between these 2 groups?

2. For those in the 9-month appointment, are you allowed to get a job outside the university for the remaining 3 months or is that not allowed? How do you support yourself on those 3 months w/o stipend?"
fj4qzzm,fb815r,2020-02-29 14:20:08,"1. Grant money for GSR or being lucky/playing politics enough for a summer TA or full teaching role (or occasionally a fellowship). You can also be employed at 100% time over the summer, so it makes a big deal.

2. Possibly, some might, but you're mostly still expected to be doing research work the whole time. In STEM you're often a full-time researcher throughout the year, including the summer, my understanding is it's more complicated in the humanities."

Nonetheless, most non-professional (eg law, business, medical) terminal degree programs are funded to a level that grad students can maintain basic standards of living in order to to do the work they need to do.  Many of us already carry significant debt from our undergrad, or other graduate education (most PhD students in my dept already have a MA or MFA when admitted; we already have prestigious degrees). When I was accepted, it was possible to survive here on that stipend. That is no longer the case."

So, you're arguing that the grad students are pursuing worthless degrees, so they should be paid *more* to pursue them?  My guess is it depends a lot on your major how much you will get paid, and most of the STEM grads are going to be doing just fine after college."

fjaxgba,fb815r,2020-03-02 12:54:21,"It's been estimated that the COLA would cost $13 mil, which, given UCSC's latest operating budget report (2016) represents 1.8% of UCSC's operational budget (total of $722 mil). Revenue and expenditures have likely increased 4 years later, but the $13 mil represents a 1.8% increase in operational cost. The UCSC administration would have to cut other programs' budgets in order to make the difference.

I'm an UCSC alumnus, and I served as a student rep on UCSC's Academic Senate's Committee on Planning and Budget (CPB). I've sided with the graduate students in this case. If you follow this subreddit, you will see the student body is largely divided on the issue. Now, subreddit posts are a small sample of the student body.But, it does affect the perception as well as the notoriety of UCSC being a liberal school full of hippies that always fight for worker's rights. It is harder to rebuild that kind of reputation in the school's brand. And it also negatively affects alumni fundraising.

It puts the UCSC administration between a rock and a hard place. I've worked with the administration in the past. They are intelligent and caring faculty members trying to walk a tight rope every year with UCOP/Regents increasingly demanding in delivering in business objectives (increase enrollment/revenue) on one side and their academic mission on the other. I do not envy them.

UCOP miscalculated this entire affair. UCSC grads going on strike has also encouraged UC Berkeley's and Davis's grads to strike in solidarity. The administration has never been able to handle student protests with the best optics, and unfortunately, student protests historically do not succeed in getting their demands met. It is.. a teachable moment, well steeped in irony."
fjchi1f,fb815r,2020-03-02 23:25:29,"Just a couple thoughts:

The thing that gets me is that the admin have seemingly never pulled the ""we can't afford it"" card (might be wrong, any sources saying otherwise are welcome). If it's true that they can't afford to grant a COLA without cuts to more important expenditures than I feel like they would be rallying behind that point rather than ""we signed a contract."" 

Also you never come to the bargaining table with the amount you expect to walk away with so the actual costs would likely be lower.

And yeah UCOP is pretty damn good at making a a shitty image for themselves."
fjdzqvt,fb815r,2020-03-03 11:06:38,"Well. “We signed a contract” is a better argument than “we can’t afford it.” During my student tenure, there were massive budget reductions and massive increases to tuition, so that argument worked during that era.

Not everyone has access to the benefits you’ve listed, such as tuition remission and healthcare coverage  (unless it’s changed since I’ve graduated). I think every graduate student’s situation is different, especially if you’re out of state/here on a student visa. 

Graduates are the backbone to the university. The school can offer much more classes and larger classes with the support of the graduates. Everyone deserves the dignity of a respectable wage for their contributions. 

Lastly, your argument that not everyone has this is a fallacy. Just because one group doesn’t have doesn’t mean other groups shouldn’t have it. Instead of a race to the bottom, let’s lift each other up. Society will be better for it."

fjvqpfa,fb815r,2020-03-07 17:13:15,"1. This is patently false, it is a norm to receive financial support for a PhD program. It is also ridiculous to charge tuition to fourth and fifth year students who don't take any classes.

2. So what if it is voluntary? Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? 

3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.

4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.

Moreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.

5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.

6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.

However, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

It's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.

So yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.

7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.

Unfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. 

8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.

9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)

You also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.

10. Then the school can try and withold pay.

It's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."
fk144rt,fb815r,2020-03-09 09:40:16,"I think you're looking at the trees and not seeing the forest. If you take a step back it's easy to see that COLA is a bandaid on a bullet hole. The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they're asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. 

Plus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don't run out of money and aren't forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That's a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.

I hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending."

Indeed. Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades. Actions speak louder than words, friend. 

To amend your analogy, this is the graduates saying ""well the right way to fix this is too difficult, so let's do COLA instead."""

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall?

Yes.

>Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."
fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."

fmcsjcw,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:12:53,"You ask the University to negotiate with strikers, but the Union is now pressing ULP charges against the University for negotiating outside the contract and for changing the ""terms of employment"", meaning funding guarantees and a $2500 annual COLA for all terminal degree students.  I think it's pretty clear why the administration won't talk to strikers: the Union won't let them.

I can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you're attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That's less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).

Also, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I'm not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.

We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life."
fmcxcae,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:58:57,"The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. 

I agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don't fund their students. That doesn't change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I'm honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn't fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don't have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor's told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.

I don't think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. 

Arguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). 

This is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). 

Ignoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. 


While I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that. It's easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I've seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven't people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term."

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

fj881vw,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:00:16,"if you're talking about TA stipends, it's pre-tax and applies to the 9 months of the regular school year - so post-tax it's about $2200/month, which for 9 months is $19,800

the tricky thing in calculating grad pay is the way our roles as student and worker overlap. you can ask about this over on r/gradschool if you want to know more about this, but basically your pay is supposed to cover living expenses so that you can also do 20-40 hours/week of coursework, research, etc - it's so that people who aren't independently wealthy are able to attend grad school without needing to take out loans or get another job, because that impedes research progress, slows graduation, etc. so while nominally our pay is for 20 hrs/week, it's difficult to compare it to a ""normal"" job. Basically the expectation is that you will be putting in full work hours in terms of all your responsibilities as a grad student, but you only get paid for the 20-ish you spend TAing - so for grading, holding section, office hours, etc. Does that make sense?

grad instructors who teach their own courses (GSIs) and researchers (GSRs) do get paid at a higher rate, but I don't have the numbers for that off the top of my head and I don't want to give you wrong/misleading information here. From anecdotal discussions I know it's not all that much more, I don't want to make it sound like they're raking it in."

fj8c4qu,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:45:34,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but tuition waivers aren't income, and are standard across all reputable PhD programs. One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don't include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren't taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there's some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I'm not sure what it would be. I'd actually describe it more as a coupon.

You might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I've described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you'd like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.

tl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it's not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad"
fj90ar1,fb815r,2020-03-01 21:38:51,"Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

I understand you have to check those comments because doxxing is a real issue you can't afford to chalk up to over-sensitivity by the reporting party.  But maybe you can add and broadcast a subreddit rule that excess reporting of threads not found to violate the other rules, will result in a ban?  And maybe restrict posting/commenting rights to members of a certain age (week old accounts or accounts with at least 20 posts total)?  Those two things have been employed successfully to stop this behavior in other subreddits.  I understand that in the short term, just locking threads is a practical solution, but it destroys the viability of the sub if it continues for long."

The thing that gets me is that the admin have seemingly never pulled the ""we can't afford it"" card (might be wrong, any sources saying otherwise are welcome). If it's true that they can't afford to grant a COLA without cuts to more important expenditures than I feel like they would be rallying behind that point rather than ""we signed a contract."" 

Also you never come to the bargaining table with the amount you expect to walk away with so the actual costs would likely be lower.

And yeah UCOP is pretty damn good at making a a shitty image for themselves."

1412\*9months\*1800 students is over 20 million dollars, that's in addition to the roughly 20 million dollars they already spend on us.  I feel this school has treated me well and it upsets me to see these spoiled little kids trashing it.

As I told them before,

They should be ashamed of themselves.  I am ashamed to be a UCSC grad myself right now. Their tactics are unfair, they got a win(5 yrs unqualified support for all grads plus 2500 annual housing stipend on top of our salary), considered it a loss, and chose to be fired. Now they are asking to be reinstated. Ri-freaking-diculous.

To the general public:

1). We take home $2,100 cash after taxes for a maximum of 20 hr work weeks

2) They are asking for an additional $1,400 gross income

3) We receive tuition remission

4) We receive excellent health care

5) We have access to emergency funds via slug support

6) We have access to free food pantries once a week which I myself have used (boohoo?)

7) We are all eligible as grads for $20k/yr in loans, which you would presumably take out if, I don't know, your circumstances were dire, or like, you had a kid

These are amazing benefits for a ***graduate student***. As a news flash, a ton of people spend over 30% of their income on rent. Welcome to California*, stop acting like you're better or more righteous than the rest of us."
fjdzeqn,fb815r,2020-03-03 11:03:29,"Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. My number is different because I didn’t have an accurate student count. 

Not everyone has access to the benefits you’ve listed, such as tuition remission and healthcare coverage  (unless it’s changed since I’ve graduated). I think every graduate student’s situation is different, especially if you’re out of state/here on a student visa. 

Graduates are the backbone to the university. The school can offer much more classes and larger classes with the support of the graduates. Everyone deserves the dignity of a respectable wage for their contributions. 

Lastly, your argument that not everyone has this is a fallacy. Just because one group doesn’t have doesn’t mean other groups shouldn’t have it. Instead of a race to the bottom, let’s lift each other up. Society will be better for it."
fje8caz,fb815r,2020-03-03 12:23:17,Every single grad as a TA or GSR has access to everything I listed. The possible exception is the loan but there are likely other loan sources they could look at.  But every single one of us has great healthcare and tuition remission and a killer wage (like 30/hr) for their part-time (20 hr max workweek) job.

fjvqpfa,fb815r,2020-03-07 17:13:15,"1. This is patently false, it is a norm to receive financial support for a PhD program. It is also ridiculous to charge tuition to fourth and fifth year students who don't take any classes.

2. So what if it is voluntary? Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? 

3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.

4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.

Moreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.

5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.

6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.

However, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

It's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.

So yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.

7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.

Unfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. 

8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.

9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)

You also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.

10. Then the school can try and withold pay.

It's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers). You deserve a living wage, along with every other TA."

The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they're asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. 

Plus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don't run out of money and aren't forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That's a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.

I hope the sit-ins this week change all that though. Maybe ""raising awareness"" of undergraduates studying for finals at McHenry or Baskin will miraculously get some housing built so this thing can have a happy ending."

Indeed. Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades. Actions speak louder than words, friend. 

To amend your analogy, this is the graduates saying ""well the right way to fix this is too difficult, so let's do COLA instead."""
fk32qem,fb815r,2020-03-09 21:50:12,"You're ignoring the ""COLA"" part of my reply. Long term solutions that don't support grads in the short term aren't viable solutions.

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall? Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

Yes.

>Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."
fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."

fmcsjcw,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:12:53,"You ask the University to negotiate with strikers, but the Union is now pressing ULP charges against the University for negotiating outside the contract and for changing the ""terms of employment"", meaning funding guarantees and a $2500 annual COLA for all terminal degree students.  I think it's pretty clear why the administration won't talk to strikers: the Union won't let them.

I can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you're attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That's less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).

Also, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I'm not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.

We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life."
fmcxcae,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:58:57,"The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. 

I agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don't fund their students. That doesn't change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I'm honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn't fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don't have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor's told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.

I don't think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. 

Arguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). 

This is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). 

Ignoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. 


While I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that. It's easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I've seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven't people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term."

fn26ret,fb815r,2020-04-10 21:30:11,"I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". 

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

the tricky thing in calculating grad pay is the way our roles as student and worker overlap. you can ask about this over on r/gradschool if you want to know more about this, but basically your pay is supposed to cover living expenses so that you can also do 20-40 hours/week of coursework, research, etc - it's so that people who aren't independently wealthy are able to attend grad school without needing to take out loans or get another job, because that impedes research progress, slows graduation, etc. so while nominally our pay is for 20 hrs/week, it's difficult to compare it to a ""normal"" job. Basically the expectation is that you will be putting in full work hours in terms of all your responsibilities as a grad student, but you only get paid for the 20-ish you spend TAing - so for grading, holding section, office hours, etc. Does that make sense?

grad instructors who teach their own courses (GSIs) and researchers (GSRs) do get paid at a higher rate, but I don't have the numbers for that off the top of my head and I don't want to give you wrong/misleading information here.

fj8c4qu,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:45:34,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but tuition waivers aren't income, and are standard across all reputable PhD programs. One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don't include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren't taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there's some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I'm not sure what it would be. I'd actually describe it more as a coupon.

You might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I've described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you'd like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.

tl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it's not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad"
fj90ar1,fb815r,2020-03-01 21:38:51,"Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

Not everyone has access to the benefits you’ve listed, such as tuition remission and healthcare coverage  (unless it’s changed since I’ve graduated). I think every graduate student’s situation is different, especially if you’re out of state/here on a student visa. 

Graduates are the backbone to the university. The school can offer much more classes and larger classes with the support of the graduates. Everyone deserves the dignity of a respectable wage for their contributions. 

Lastly, your argument that not everyone has this is a fallacy. Just because one group doesn’t have doesn’t mean other groups shouldn’t have it. Instead of a race to the bottom, let’s lift each other up. Society will be better for it."

The best case scenario is that grads get the COLA they're asking for, and then shut down the university again in two years because COLA failed fix the supply-side housing shortage that drove prices up to begin with. 

Plus, if things are as bad as you say, and most grads are living in a situation where an unexpected $2000 expense will leave them bankrupt, then the fired grads have little more than a few weeks left before they run out of money and are forced to leave their programs. otoh, if they don't run out of money and aren't forced to quit, then the case for COLA was always weak, and COLA was never necessary. That's a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.

Indeed. Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades. Actions speak louder than words, friend. 

To amend your analogy, this is the graduates saying ""well the right way to fix this is too difficult, so let's do COLA instead."""
fk32qem,fb815r,2020-03-09 21:50:12,"You're ignoring the ""COLA"" part of my reply. Long term solutions that don't support grads in the short term aren't viable solutions.

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall? Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing? If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems."

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."
fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."
fk41jz4,fb815r,2020-03-10 07:42:20,"Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm ignoring a lot of what you say, in this particular case because I don't care *whose fault it is*. That's a useless conversation to have. I care about *outcomes*, and I don't advocate for retribution. COLA will exacerbate the situation over time. That's a negative outcome, and that's why I won't support it. 

If you're going to ask for a temporary solution that benefits a tiny minority of people affected by the cost of living here, then you won't have my support, ever. Full stop. If, on the other hand, you advocated a solution for the long term, and for someone other than yourselves, I would stand beside you. If you can't find such a solution, then you need to sit down.

fmcsjcw,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:12:53,"You ask the University to negotiate with strikers, but the Union is now pressing ULP charges against the University for negotiating outside the contract and for changing the ""terms of employment"", meaning funding guarantees and a $2500 annual COLA for all terminal degree students.  I think it's pretty clear why the administration won't talk to strikers: the Union won't let them.

I can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you're attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That's less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).

Also, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I'm not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political ""adversaries"" than perhaps you realize.

We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life."
fmcxcae,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:58:57,"The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. 

I agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don't fund their students. That doesn't change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I'm honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn't fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don't have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor's told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.

I don't think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. 

Arguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). 

This is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). 

Ignoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. 


While I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that. It's easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I've seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven't people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term."

fmy9dql,fb815r,2020-04-09 18:09:26,"I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault. It's ironic that in the same sentence that you would condemn me for calling you dishonest, you manage to misrepresent what I said.

Your comparison between strikers and anti-immigration advocates relies on nothing but surface level similarities and ignores the underlying philosophical and ideological differences that structure those arguments. It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. 

It is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."

fn26ret,fb815r,2020-04-10 21:30:11,"I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". 

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

fj881vw,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:00:16,"if you're talking about TA stipends, it's pre-tax and applies to the 9 months of the regular school year - so post-tax it's about $2200/month, which for 9 months is $19,800

the tricky thing in calculating grad pay is the way our roles as student and worker overlap. you can ask about this over on r/gradschool if you want to know more about this, but basically your pay is supposed to cover living expenses so that you can also do 20-40 hours/week of coursework, research, etc - it's so that people who aren't independently wealthy are able to attend grad school without needing to take out loans or get another job, because that impedes research progress, slows graduation, etc. so while nominally our pay is for 20 hrs/week, it's difficult to compare it to a ""normal"" job. Basically the expectation is that you will be putting in full work hours in terms of all your responsibilities as a grad student, but you only get paid for the 20-ish you spend TAing - so for grading, holding section, office hours, etc. Does that make sense?

grad instructors who teach their own courses (GSIs) and researchers (GSRs) do get paid at a higher rate, but I don't have the numbers for that off the top of my head and I don't want to give you wrong/misleading information here.

fj8c4qu,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:45:34,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but tuition waivers aren't income, and are standard across all reputable PhD programs. One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don't include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren't taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there's some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I'm not sure what it would be. I'd actually describe it more as a coupon.

You might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I've described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you'd like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.

tl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it's not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad"
fj90ar1,fb815r,2020-03-01 21:38:51,"Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

Indeed. Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades. Actions speak louder than words, friend. 

To amend your analogy, this is the graduates saying ""well the right way to fix this is too difficult, so let's do COLA instead."""

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall?

Yes.

>Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."
fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."

fmcxcae,fb815r,2020-04-03 15:58:57,"The university should reopen the contract with the union. The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. 

I agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don't fund their students. That doesn't change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I'm honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn't fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don't have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor's told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.

I don't think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. 

Arguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). 

This is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). 

Ignoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. 


While I agree with the sentiment that ""We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life"", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that. It's easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem. I've seen some good suggestions about long term fixes to the housing problem in Santa Cruz, but I haven't people opposed to COLA suggest anything that would help anyone ""live a decent life"" in the short term."

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

fj8c4qu,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:45:34,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but tuition waivers aren't income, and are standard across all reputable PhD programs. One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don't include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren't taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there's some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I'm not sure what it would be. I'd actually describe it more as a coupon.

You might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I've described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you'd like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.

tl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it's not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad"
fj90ar1,fb815r,2020-03-01 21:38:51,"Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

fk2ts8n,fb815r,2020-03-09 19:56:25,"> but realistic a COLA + political pressure on the city to greenlight new developments is probably the best we can do

Indeed. Unfortunately, if this was true, COLA would have taken up residence at City Hall or something, and you would be inconveniencing the locals who can actually cast votes to fix the problem instead of taking this out on undergraduates by blocking the base of campus and withholding our grades. Actions speak louder than words, friend. 

To amend your analogy, this is the graduates saying ""well the right way to fix this is too difficult, so let's do COLA instead."""
fk32qem,fb815r,2020-03-09 21:50:12,"You're ignoring the ""COLA"" part of my reply. Long term solutions that don't support grads in the short term aren't viable solutions.

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall? Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing? If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems."

Yes.

>Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."
fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."
fk41jz4,fb815r,2020-03-10 07:42:20,"Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm ignoring a lot of what you say, in this particular case because I don't care *whose fault it is*. That's a useless conversation to have. I care about *outcomes*, and I don't advocate for retribution. COLA will exacerbate the situation over time. That's a negative outcome, and that's why I won't support it. 

If you're going to ask for a temporary solution that benefits a tiny minority of people affected by the cost of living here, then you won't have my support, ever. Full stop. If, on the other hand, you advocated a solution for the long term, and for someone other than yourselves, I would stand beside you. If you can't find such a solution, then you need to sit down.

fmy9dql,fb815r,2020-04-09 18:09:26,"I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault. It's ironic that in the same sentence that you would condemn me for calling you dishonest, you manage to misrepresent what I said.

Your comparison between strikers and anti-immigration advocates relies on nothing but surface level similarities and ignores the underlying philosophical and ideological differences that structure those arguments. It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. 

It is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."

fn26ret,fb815r,2020-04-10 21:30:11,"I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". 

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

fj8c4qu,fb815r,2020-03-01 16:45:34,"The short answer is ""yes,"" but tuition waivers aren't income, and are standard across all reputable PhD programs. One of the first bits of advice given to prospective applicants is not to accept any offers that don't include a full tuition waiver. I know it sounds like a ""full ride"" in undergrad, but grad school is usually only ~2 years of coursework, with the rest spent writing, researching, and preparing for qualifying exams. Tuition waivers are an odd kind of fake money, in that the university charges us tuition for courses we aren't taking, then ""pays"" the bill to itself. Maybe there's some accounting reason to handle it this way, but if there is, I'm not sure what it would be. I'd actually describe it more as a coupon.

You might have seen a couple years ago that there was a proposal to tax tuition waivers as income, and it was almost universally criticized for the reasons I've described - I can link you some of the better articles on it, if you'd like to see more in-depth explanations of how these waivers work.

tl;dr: yes, but tuition works differently, so it's not a giveaway in the sense of getting a scholarship in undergrad"
fj90ar1,fb815r,2020-03-01 21:38:51,"Tuition isn't just when you take courses - it's also to reflect the fact that faculty are given credit for 1-2 courses in part to reflect the time they spend mentoring grad students (the official teaching load is 5 courses per year, but faculty actually teach 3 or 4, depending on department). So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

fk32qem,fb815r,2020-03-09 21:50:12,"You're ignoring the ""COLA"" part of my reply. Long term solutions that don't support grads in the short term aren't viable solutions.

I'm not gonna speculate about the effectiveness of protesting in front of city hall, but grads can't be in two places at once, and fighting for a COLA is a more pressing issue than the long term fight for better development policy. Suppose grads protested in front of city hall and that somehow forced the city council's hand to greenlight new developments. What does that do for people struggling right now? Absolutely nothing. It might help people years down the line, but certainly not now.

There's a bunch of other thoughts I have about how grads are university employees and this is a work stoppage, or the fact that this problem isn't solely the city's fault, but also a result of the university's unsustainable expansion policies. We could also talk about how protesting city hall is not the only solution to the housing crisis and how strikers have been engaged in local politics (organizing in opposition to the recall, trying to get students out to vote, etc). 

But somehow, I don't think any of that really matters to you. You think you've found the silver bullet to this problem, which just happens to be the one that doesn't inconvenience you in the slightest. Did you vote to oppose the recall? Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing? If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems."

Yes.

>Have you been engaged in get out the vote efforts or other forms of local political organizing?

No, because I don't think this is the problem. The problem is NIMBYism. I think we would have better luck adopting expansion efforts that would appeal to both NIMBYists and to our students. If we try to simply outnumber NIMBYists, then in two years when a new group of students is here, we'll backslide into the same situation we're in now. Much like we will with COLA. I think this sucks enough that it deserves a permanent solution.

>If you haven't been engaged in this issue or local politics at all, maybe you shouldn't be so confident in your knowledge of the ""right way"" to solve complex socio-economic problems.

Don't judge me. And don't pretend that just because I disagree with you that I'm uninformed."

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."

fmy9dql,fb815r,2020-04-09 18:09:26,"I didn't call your experiences dishonest, but rather your claim that the adminstration's reluctance to negotiate was somehow the union's fault. It's ironic that in the same sentence that you would condemn me for calling you dishonest, you manage to misrepresent what I said.

Your comparison between strikers and anti-immigration advocates relies on nothing but surface level similarities and ignores the underlying philosophical and ideological differences that structure those arguments. It's telling that instead of choosing to respond to my explanation of the differences, you instead chose to express faux outrage that I dared to call your superficial, half-baked comparison intellectually lazy. 

It is then not at all surprising that, when being called out for making bad/dishonest arguments, you would immediately appropriate a quote from a Holocaust survivor."

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

So even when graduate students aren't taking classes, there is still a cost to the university.

Also, grad courses are almost always smaller than undergrad classes, grad students get office space that has cost associated with it, have a lower student:staff ratio for advising, and a number of other things that make graduate education more costly on a per-student basis than undergrad education. Tuition waivers are only an internal transfer in the case of TA and GSI positions; for GSR and external fellowships, the tuition waiver is covered from external sources (the research grant or by the fellowship agency)."

fjldnu6,fb815r,2020-03-05 13:47:11,"To some degree, I am. Some STEM PhDs go into industry and may find high-paying jobs, but the ones who are pursuing academic jobs have a tough road ahead.  PhDs are rarely a good financial investment, you can get more lucrative non-academic jobs with a masters degree.

[ed:] This is to point out that many grad students are already making sacrifices to pursue a PhD."

That’s how awesome our insurance is.  Want the phone # to ask for yourself?

fk39awq,fb815r,2020-03-09 23:44:43,"Well the problem isn't just NIMBYists, is it? It's also homeowners with vested economic interests against expansion.

But suppose that it was just NIMBYists, what expansion efforts would they be supportive of? It's easy to say just work with the NIMBYists on a shared solution, a little harder to do in practice. Again, there aren't silver bullets to this problem. 

You're also ignoring my argument that it's the university's fault. Yes, the homeowners have been obstructionist, but the university is the one that keeps admitting new students when there already aren't affordable rooms for students here. Is UCSC going to stop expanding while the city builds new housing? Of course not, they are gonna admit a couple thousand more students before any new rooms are available. So let's not pretend that this is just the NIMBYists or the homeowners, it's also UCOP and the UCSC admin."
fk41jz4,fb815r,2020-03-10 07:42:20,"Yes, you're absolutely right. I'm ignoring a lot of what you say, in this particular case because I don't care *whose fault it is*. That's a useless conversation to have. I care about *outcomes*, and I don't advocate for retribution. COLA will exacerbate the situation over time. That's a negative outcome, and that's why I won't support it. 

If you're going to ask for a temporary solution that benefits a tiny minority of people affected by the cost of living here, then you won't have my support, ever. Full stop. If, on the other hand, you advocated a solution for the long term, and for someone other than yourselves, I would stand beside you. If you can't find such a solution, then you need to sit down.

fn26ret,fb815r,2020-04-10 21:30:11,"I did not say you were dishonest for ""observing that the Union in filing ULP charges against the University for negotiating with entities other than the Union at the same time that COLA strikers are demanding that the University negotiate with them"" or ""arguing that the Union is crossing purposes with COLA strikers in this regard"". 

I said it was dishonest to claim that the university's refusal to negotiate was the fault of the union when the union has been WILLING TO NEGOTIATE. You at best have made an argument for why the university might not want to negotiate with the wildcats directly. But the movement has openly called for the reopening of contract negotiations with the union, as has the union. To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.

You say ""it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates."" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the ""reasoning"" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. 

I do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that ""you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly"" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.

Interestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who ""disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken"", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. 

Your unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument? I'd reflect on that a little before you cast aspersions of ideological rigidity."

kiomse0,19azpzl,2024-01-19 18:20:34,"Housing is really tough. I would say that’s the most difficult part of living here (for me at least). The city is really cool, and the forest is massive and full of cool stuff to see. Plenty of fun things to do in town as well. Just the cost of living it toughhh"
kiov76c,19azpzl,2024-01-19 19:20:44,"I'm from southern California too. I did my undergrad at UCSB and I'm finishing up the last year of my PhD.

I think you shouldn't have a hard time making friends if you're outgoing. I've met a lot of great people (students and faculty) in my department, and I have a great relationship with my advisor. 

Santa Cruz is beautiful, but finding housing is really hard and mostly not at all affordable. It's a small city but still pulls in cool bands at the local venues, and SF and SJ aren't too far if you find yourself missing a big city."
kiovjpi,19azpzl,2024-01-19 19:23:18,"as a current grad student here, I can say UCSC is a good experience, but I do think it greatly depends on the department you are in. As a fellow SO-Cal native (Riverside) I'll say the food is a big difference from down south. It's more expensive up here, there's less options, it feels like everything closes early, and it's VERY hit or miss. I've gone to many places and spent $30'ish for a basic meal (burger& fry, Chinese, BBQ, pizza) and was not happy with the quality. I don't think I've found a Mexican restaurant that has the same quality as a good Southern California taqueria, but there's a few that are acceptable. housing is the biggest problem for UCSC, listen to the others on this post and start looking now if you are coming in the fall."
kirjhwl,19azpzl,2024-01-20 09:34:07,The one taqueria I would say is comparable is the los pericos in downtown

I like that a lot of the restaurants are locally owned and thus dont mind paying more than i would back home (& mexican food is pretty consistent @ ~12 burrito, $3.50/taco) .  keeping drive thrus off highway 1 is a big value for santa cruz so our fast food/late night pickings are super slim. i think taco bell is some of the only food reliably open after 11pm. 

all in all though u can def eat pretty well on a budget especially if you’re cooking your own meals.

kipo1xr,19b2xyy,2024-01-19 23:50:00,"This is a small department and everybody knows each other. Many often list rooms and share apartments. try and reach out to fellow AM PhD cohorts when you get accepted. Also I think that department guarantees 5 years of funding and if you do a few things that are required of you (TA/GSR) then your education is essentially free and you get monthly pay on top of that, it's not a ton of money, but I don't think anybody is pulling loans to put themselves thru the AM PhD. You might also be able to get graduate housing for a year, but I honestly don't know, that would be a question to ask the school"
kipbz8e,19b2xyy,2024-01-19 21:39:21,"It’s tough, but youll find something. Everyone I know eventually finds something. I didn’t find my spot off campus until June, and my old roommates when I was living on campus followed suite and found something as a group of 2 a couple weeks later.

You just gotta be proactive and just look. Most stuff aren’t advertised until like March April May, I should know, I’m a prospective masters student who hopes on moving into someplace new off campus once I graduate here."
kiqnzak,19b2xyy,2024-01-20 06:15:15,"You deal with the cost the same way you deal with any cost. You get a job or you take out loans.   
My advice is that you start saving now, don't wait to see where you get accepted. If you don't have a job already then go get one today. If you are accepted, start looking for a place and move to Santa Cruz at the end of spring / beginning of summer when all the students begin to abandon their housing. Try to find a place that's flexible so you can bail if you find something better before summer ends.

Get two jobs and work your ass off, in the mean time, start applying for RA positions (you will get free housing if you're an RA) and anything else that will help alleviate your rent costs. Start looking for better jobs, find something that will be accommodating and work well for your busy school schedule.  


After summer is over you should have a little money saved up and hopefully an affordable place to live and a good side gig.  Eventually you can probably get a job interning or working in a lab on campus or something and turn your side gig into a career booster.   


Obviously, fulfilling your PhD duties, having a side job, and working on your PhD is going to be a heavy load, but that's life out here in Santa Cruz.   


If you want something more lowkey for yourself then just go to school somewhere with cheaper housing."
kis4dyw,19b2xyy,2024-01-20 11:35:56,PhD programs that I am familiar with cover tuition and also provide a monthly stipend to cover your expenses.  My son was getting about $32K per year in an Astrophysics program in Colorado.

Now they’re taking it away again? Can they just make up their minds? (FWIW, my grad school offers lifetime email for alums, but it’s a different email address than the one I had as a student)"
kiisog8,199xddx,2024-01-18 17:03:24,"Hi there, Lisa Bono here from ITS. We wish we could have kept Alumni Google services for life - that was our intention. However, Google announced in 2021 a storage model change that involved no longer offering free, unlimited storage to accounts using their services, including higher education institutions like our campus. As a result, this change requires storage limits to be placed on every UC Santa Cruz Google account, and for us to discontinue Google Services to alumni. Current alumni still get to keep their  UCSC Gmail account, but with requirements. Here's more info: https://its.ucsc.edu/projects/google-changes-alumni.html"
kiitg3n,199xddx,2024-01-18 17:08:29,"I think that makes sense, I’m fine with just having my inbox with limited storage. Even just having the ability to set up a forwarding address would suffice.

Any reason why we can’t just automatically migrate alum accounts to the new limited email account without having to opt-in?"
kiivgt2,199xddx,2024-01-18 17:21:54,"Great question! We considered automatically migrating alumni accounts to the new email service, but not every alum is interested in having a UCSC email address. Many of them are not aware that they have one. We are aiming for the new service to be exclusively for those alumni who genuinely want it. Hopefully the form is quick and not too cumbersome. I created the form and if you have any feedback about making it better, let me know!"
kij582y,199xddx,2024-01-18 18:27:46,What about future students who may genuinely want an email address/forwarding email? As a prospective student who is very undecided on UCSC (and getting increasingly more so) this is very disappointing to see.
kim2j9k,199xddx,2024-01-19 09:10:29,"Thankfully, future students will be able to keep their UCSC email address/forwarding. I will make sure that is stated in communications we send to incoming new students."
kij9cex,199xddx,2024-01-18 18:55:54,"Hi Lisa, thanks for commenting. I understand that Google’s changes made the current system financially prohibitive to maintain and think cutting accounts down to email only is completely fair. However I think making it opt-in is frustrating because many alumni check their account rarely and may easily miss the planned deletion, + because of the added burden. It kinda feels like a measure to get many alumni to simply not bother opting in to their email, in order for the school to save more money. The opt-in process feels frustrating in that I not only have to go submit a request to keep the account, but I myself also used to clean out all the other Google services (they’re being deleted anyway, why do I need to do this manually?), and if I miss remaining data anywhere, I risk still having my email and all my email data deleted.

IMO the alumni email should be kept by default, and only the data should be deleted if the user does not reduce their data use to meet the 0.5GB cap. That would be the best faith effort by the university to still meet the original promise of life time email access. Otherwise at least the burden of the opt in process should be reduced."
kils6ga,199xddx,2024-01-19 08:12:34,"Good points, all around. I totally get that all the necessary requirements needed just to keep your email address, is a lot to ask. There is an option on the form to keep your email and let ITS delete your files for you. I know it's not much, but we wanted to lift the burden for folks that need it.  I will take your comments back to the technical and alumni engagement team."
kijpxa5,199xddx,2024-01-18 21:00:17,What about graduate alumni? I wanted to keep my email address but it was discontinued ~6 months after I graduated. Any chance that would get reinstated?
kilspm1,199xddx,2024-01-19 08:15:36,You for sure can keep your UCSC email address and get it reinstated. Best thing to do is open a support ticket so we can get you all set up. https://slughub.ucsc.edu/its

Please know that this change that goes into effect on April 16, 2024, is for current alumni. If you will be graduating this June, you will get to keep your UCSC Gmail account with all the other Google services (Drive, Groups, Calendar, etc.) for one year after you leave campus. When that year is up, you will be prompted to request to keep your UCSC Gmail account. So, for anyone of you graduating this upcoming June, there isn't anything you need to do."
kijk7lq,199xddx,2024-01-18 20:14:33,"Will the prompt to keep the account be every year, once per year, or just the one time?"

That person will automatically keep all their UCSC Google services for 12 months. 90 days before the 12 months is up, that person will receive a notice with all the information on how to keep their UCSC email address, and any other instructions. Then a 60 day, 30 day, and two week notice. After that, I don't think ITS will reach out again. If the person elects to keep their email, then no further notices are needed. If the person does nothing (ignores or doesn't see the notices) their UCSC email will be disabled. Not deleted. Just disabled and data removed. Hope this helps."

I understand that Google’s changes made the current system financially prohibitive to maintain and think cutting accounts down to email only is completely fair. However I think making it opt-in is frustrating because many alumni check their account rarely and may easily miss the planned deletion, + because of the added burden.

IMO the alumni email should be kept by default, and only the data should be deleted if the user does not reduce their data use to meet the 0.5GB cap.

kiltamc,199xddx,2024-01-19 08:18:56,"Hi there, Lisa Bono here from ITS. CruzID accounts are never deleted, so your email address ""sammyslug@ucsc.edu"" remains even though it may not be used or active."
kilum7x,199xddx,2024-01-19 08:26:27,"Great question. Let's take a person who is graduating this June as an example. That person will automatically keep all their UCSC Google services for 12 months. 90 days before the 12 months is up, that person will receive a notice with all the information on how to keep their UCSC email address, and any other instructions. Then a 60 day, 30 day, and two week notice. After that, I don't think ITS will reach out again. If the person elects to keep their email, then no further notices are needed. If the person does nothing (ignores or doesn't see the notices) their UCSC email will be disabled. Not deleted. Just disabled and data removed. Hope this helps."

kiirim5,199xddx,2024-01-18 16:55:45,"Hi, Lisa Bono here from ITS. As alumni, you get to keep your CruzID and Gold password and will still have access to campus systems like MyUCSC, library services, etc. That will never go away. As alumni, starting April 16, you won't be able to access your UCSC Google account via your CruzID and Gold password (SSO). If you are alumni and wish to keep your UCSC Gmail account (without the other Google services) then you will need to [request to keep it](https://its.ucsc.edu/projects/google-changes-alumni.html#actions)."
kijazvx,199xddx,2024-01-18 19:07:26,thanks for the reply -- can we still use the UCSC SSO to login to web-based applications? I couldn't tell from your reply.
kijb4dt,199xddx,2024-01-18 19:08:18,and I am not clear what you are saying -- sounds like we can keep CruzID and Gold but then you say after 04/16/24 we cannot???
kilvlmr,199xddx,2024-01-19 08:31:59,"Sorry for the confusing! You will always and forever be able to keep your CruzID and Gold password.

I hope that is clearer, but if not, please open a support ticket and we can contact you directly to answer your specific questions. There are a lot of moving parts to this change, and it's complicated, so your questions are very valid. We want to make sure folks know that their CruzID isn't going away."

Okay, let’s get this clarified and be done. 

I am currently using all UCSC Google services, including an alias on my given email address. I am also using the email/username as an SSO for non-UCSC web applications. 

As of 04/16/24, I can use email, email alias, and SSO, but nothing else. Is that correct? And my CruzID and Gold Pass will stay with me forever.

Please confirm or clarify further. 

Thanks!"
kimjnqs,199xddx,2024-01-19 10:44:20,"Yep, that is correct. Just make sure to [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/zH6f22oF378Tx6SW7) to keep your UCSC email address and make sure to export the files/photos that you wish to keep from Google Drive, Photos, etc. by April 16th."
kipdex4,199xddx,2024-01-19 21:53:01,Can we get a paid option to keep the services?
kiivgt2,199xddx,2024-01-18 17:21:54,"Great question! We considered automatically migrating alumni accounts to the new email service, but not every alum is interested in having a UCSC email address. Many of them are not aware that they have one. We are aiming for the new service to be exclusively for those alumni who genuinely want it. Hopefully the form is quick and not too cumbersome. I created the form and if you have any feedback about making it better, let me know!"
kij582y,199xddx,2024-01-18 18:27:46,What about future students who may genuinely want an email address/forwarding email? As a prospective student who is very undecided on UCSC (and getting increasingly more so) this is very disappointing to see.

kij9cex,199xddx,2024-01-18 18:55:54,"Hi Lisa, thanks for commenting. I understand that Google’s changes made the current system financially prohibitive to maintain and think cutting accounts down to email only is completely fair. However I think making it opt-in is frustrating because many alumni check their account rarely and may easily miss the planned deletion, + because of the added burden. It kinda feels like a measure to get many alumni to simply not bother opting in to their email, in order for the school to save more money. The opt-in process feels frustrating in that I not only have to go submit a request to keep the account, but I myself also used to clean out all the other Google services (they’re being deleted anyway, why do I need to do this manually?), and if I miss remaining data anywhere, I risk still having my email and all my email data deleted.

IMO the alumni email should be kept by default, and only the data should be deleted if the user does not reduce their data use to meet the 0.5GB cap. That would be the best faith effort by the university to still meet the original promise of life time email access. Otherwise at least the burden of the opt in process should be reduced."

kilbcbp,19abhir,2024-01-19 06:31:31,You might consider cognitive science with a focus on AI/ HCI. You’ve probably met most of the technical requirements already and might enjoy the breadth and flexibility of the course options. It’s part of the Psychology dept at UCSC so is quite psych heavy as compared to other UCs who offer the major. This is the time to explore other things that you may like better. Good luck with whatever you choose!!
kim9ybd,19abhir,2024-01-19 09:50:58,"Thank you. I’ll definitely consider it, my other option would be TIM which I already meet the technical requirements to declare. I’ll look into CogSci and see where I’m at with that and what it entails."
kimceio,19abhir,2024-01-19 10:04:21,"The things I like about Cog Sci is that its sort of computer science “light” if you focus on AI/HCI. You’ll still come out of it with a technical BS degree if that’s important to you. You’ll get to take classes in psychology, CS, even linguistics and medicine if you are interested in those routes. You don’t have to go on to be a programmer if you don’t like that work but you’ll still keep a foot in the door. The things I don’t love so much about Cog Sci is that a person with a BS degree can do everything yet nothing. Meaning it can be very broad, for good or bad. The reality is that it’s a very good base degree and you could work your way into a number of different jobs and careers.  It really just depends on getting that first one. I’m rooting for you!"

If you don't know where you want to go, don't change majors yet, but talk with both your Merrill college adviser and a Baskin engineering staff adviser."

kiojnug,19abhir,2024-01-19 17:58:56,"I experienced your same journey. Failed CSE 12 during COVID and was in a difficult position looking for alternatives. First I began with a TIM Major and then I also ended up failing a physics class due to other issues specifically mental issues playing video games, weed, etc basically escaping reality. After I faced myself I found math/Econ combined major and now will be graduating with an additional CS minor. The Econ side is really misunderstood since I really focused on econometrics and it truly overlaps with CS considering AI or how causal interpretations work. When you get passed the basic pre requisites you begin to realize that almost all classes within stem overlap because knowledge becomes a spiderweb. Math is intertwined with Econ while also being intertwined with CS and I could argue the same thing in any order. Like other comments have said don’t give up .  I would suggest really question yourself if you want to continue pursuing anything in stem and give it your all while being in the present moment. Explore all options listed in the departments you find interest in and take action.  It won’t be easy but I promise you that you can do it!"

kijuzyr,19abbxk,2024-01-18 21:45:16,"i would say yeah, as freshmen you are taking classes to gain access to upper div classes and upper div electives. 12 units is generally 1 7-unit couse with lab and some other 5-unit course. you’d be missing out on a GE or progress towards your major."
kijvtz2,19abbxk,2024-01-18 21:53:04,i’d actually be taking two 5 unit classes for GEs and a 2 unit class— not sure if this changes things

kin61vm,19abbxk,2024-01-19 12:49:39,"In my opinion, it really depends on the classes you’re taking. For example, if it’s a 7 and 5 unit class, and the 7 unit class is CSE13S, then that’s totally fine. There aren’t enough credits in the world to assign to a class like that (even tho I’ve heard it’s changed I took it a long time ago). 

But if the course load is too light, then i’d say definitely take more as to not fall behind."

kikkso9,19abbxk,2024-01-19 02:42:02,"You definitely could take more, but the extra time on ur hands can also be used to experience new things, meet new people, etc. It is arguably just as important (but depends on your specific situation)"
kio9uzy,19abbxk,2024-01-19 16:53:12,honestly try to get all your GEs done now so you can only take 12 units during your senior year. i recommend taking to your college advising to make a solid four year plan so you know what you need and won’t waste time

Shakespeare Santa Cruz ended, and a new organization, Santa Cruz Shakespeare, raised money to build a new stage in Delaveaga Park (the Audrey Stanley Grove), and have been putting on plays there since (except for during the pandemic, when they did *Undiscovered Shakespeare* Zoom events with the Humanities Institute of UCSC—they now do both).

kidwxg7,1999qon,2024-01-17 19:34:29,I worked with SSC for 6 years. Summer season ran all summer. Three shows at once. Two performances a day. One indoors on the main stage. It was actually Shakespeare in the Glen named the Audrey Stanley Grove.  Founded in 1981. It was magical to see the plays in the glen under the stars. New stage every season until the damage on the glen took a toll. Loved working there. It was new for me every show. Other groups have performed there including Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald. You can look them up.

But they are now performing at Audrey Stanley Grove in Delaveaga Park, not at UCSC, which is too bad, because there is no public transit to the Grove.  They do still collaborate with UCSC faculty (Patty Gallagher is regular performer, Sean Keilen of the Humanities Institute works with them on the *Undiscovered Shakespeare* Zoom programs, and the *Weekend with Shakespeare* lectures are usually at the Arboretum)."

But they are now performing at Audrey Stanley Grove in Delaveaga Park, not at UCSC, which is too bad, because there is no public transit to the Grove.  They do still collaborate with UCSC faculty (Patty Gallagher is regular performer, Sean Keilen of the Humanities Institute works with them on the *Undiscovered Shakespeare* Zoom programs, and the *Weekend with Shakespeare* lectures are usually at the Arboretum)."

The Audrey Stanley Grove is the *new* performance space for SCS in Delaveaga Park.  The old stage was the Festival Glen.  Audrey Stanley started SSC and was a major donor to SCS.  She was a well-loved theater professor and actor."

kigkhuw,1999qon,2024-01-18 09:15:53,"That is the story I heard from a Theater Department chair, back before Theater was folded in with Games—a pairing that does not seem to have done  either program any favors.  Shakespeare Santa Cruz was in debt to UCSC (about $1M) and UCSC insisted that they pay for the upgrades to the bathrooms, which they could not do.

So UCSC kicked them out on the spurious excuse that they needed the Festival Glen for their own summer programs, but they've not used the stage since (in over 10 years), and they didn't repair the stage after a tree fell on it a year ago (or was it 2 years ago now?).

Shakespeare Santa Cruz ended, and a new organization, Santa Cruz Shakespeare, raised money to build a new stage in Delaveaga Park (the Audrey Stanley Grove), and have been putting on plays there since (except for during the pandemic, when they did *Undiscovered Shakespeare* Zoom events with the Humanities Institute of UCSC—they now do both).

It is sad that UCSC has let the Festival Glen decay so badly—it was a great summer stage."
kii1xzq,1999qon,2024-01-18 14:15:19,"The way the university treated the theater department is just so sad. The whole time I was there, 2014-18, we knew the department was dying. They kept cutting funding and classes cause there wasn't enough students, but that just led to fewer students joining the program. My boss was pretty open about the bs the department was dealing with and even tho he's retired now, he's good friends with his replacement so he still knows a lot of what's going on. Even tho a bunch of staff and faculty left/retired, the university wasn't really fast to find replacements.
As for the stage in the glen, we did use it once or twice before they shut it down again. We had just fixed up the stage, sorted out some seating, even taken some pictures with students dressed up to advertise the stage as a wedding venue. It's really sad to see that one of the trees has fallen and they haven't fixed it up at all."
kie05wp,1999qon,2024-01-17 19:57:30,"Interesting, thanks for the update. Hopefully they can get it resolved- we used to do some weird experimental stuff down there and I have very fond memories of it. 

I think it was 2011, maybe 2012- it actually snowed at UCSC. I was in the Barn rehearsing at the time, and we ran out to see the flurries. What an amazing day."
kigkrrq,1999qon,2024-01-18 09:17:27,"The ADA compliance was a bit of vulture-lawyer thing, as there are ADA-compliant bathrooms—it was just that the closest door to the Glen for the bathrooms by the ticket office was not ADA-compliant."

kiglqxi,1999qon,2024-01-18 09:22:59,"Not quite that much each year, but Shakespeare Santa Cruz was about $1M in debt to UCSC.   

The new organization that replaced them (Santa Cruz Shakespeare) adopted a different funding model—forward funding—in which money raised one year goes to fund the *next* year's production.  They also do fundraising for any construction before they build, rather than relying on debt financing.  Forward funding is unusual in the non-profit art world, but it makes for much more realistic budgeting and helps survive disasters (like losing a couple of seasons to the pandemic)."

Four years of attending a private “west side” (wealthy) high school (scholarship kid from the East Side) taught me that rich kids stole from their classmates way more than the kids from my neighborhood. No really. 

It wasn’t until I went to grad school up the road (to Stanford) that I had to worry about my stuff in buildings you HAD to have a keycard to enter. So you KNEW whoever did it was a fellow member of your program. 

UCSC was such a safe and insulated place in the 90s. There were all kinds there, but larceny was low. Very little ever went missing…or missing forever (lots of odd borrowing) but that was then? If you had a computer I’d was a behemoth in your bedroom. Not a laptop people could walk off with…so they had your books and notes to take? So…if you’re leaving out tempting stuff…don’t."

At mchenry (and Page Smith for me) if you left your books unattended you might notice paper missing from your binder…but a “new-to-you” notebook or copy paper to replace the missing pages. Or pens.

Idk if the people working there pick up unattended items or if it's only items that people turn into them, but I accidentally left a rain jacket in the library and came back for it about 45 minutes later, and they had it in the lost and found behind the desk.

I know that Zoom probably charges you a hefty premium to store videos online, and I'm sure YuJa allows you to store tens of thousands of videos much cheaper, but ho boy, my poor students are having a hellava time trying to get the videos they need. And the ucsc docs about YuJa just link to YuJa's general documentation which is disorganized and overwhelming. I'm disappointed. This feels like a rush job.

> It has taken a while to try to figure out how the YuJa interface works. It is counterintuitive to say the least. Videos end up in a Default Collection? Okay. Can I publish them there? Apparently. no. I guess I have to publish them to my course channel?  Okay.  Can I sort them by say lecture and section recordings? Maybe?

Maybe consider changing out your wifi module.  intel ax210 or better if you can."

I doubt it's the cause of your woes, but USB wifi adapters aren't ideal.

best case is a PCIE card with a remote antenna and an intel chipset.  I use [this](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-GC-WBAX210-802-11ax-Bluetooth-Expansion/dp/B091HTG6DQ), it worked well."

kie37pv,1994g4w,2024-01-17 20:20:21,"on the second link, the *card* is the thing in the second photograph.  that plugs into your motherboard in one of the open slots below your video card (leave a couple slots open below the video card so you don't starve it of air).  then the antennae screws onto the posts sticking out the back of the card.

on your motherboard, presumably the video card is plugged into the top x16 slot, i'd plug the wifi card into second slot from the bottom.  gives plenty of air all around."

Also he requires a physical copy of the textbook which you are allowed to use on quizzes and maybe tests, which I think is dumb. Really going to make us buy a textbook?

Your scrutiny of the UCSC chicken mascot in the context of gender stereotypes and its potential role in perpetuating patriarchal ideals is quite thought-provoking. Let's unpack this complex issue:  
  
Mascots and Symbolism: Mascots often carry deep symbolic meanings, embodying the spirit, values, and ethos of their institutions. The choice of a chicken as a mascot for UCSC, therefore, isn't just a whimsical decision; it's imbued with cultural and social significance. When analyzing mascots through the lens of gender norms, it's crucial to understand the layers of symbolism they carry and how these symbols are perceived and interpreted by different groups.  
  
Gender Stereotypes and Animal Mascots: The link between gender stereotypes and animal mascots can be subtle yet pervasive. If the chicken mascot exhibits traits or is portrayed in a manner that aligns with traditional gender roles or stereotypes, it could inadvertently reinforce outdated norms. This is particularly problematic if these portrayals are not critically examined or challenged, thereby normalizing certain expectations about gender roles.  
  
Mascots as Tools for Social Commentary: Mascots can also serve as tools for social commentary, either reinforcing or challenging societal norms. If the UCSC chicken mascot is used in a way that promotes patriarchal ideals, intentionally or not, it becomes a vehicle for perpetuating those norms. However, this also means that mascots have the potential to be reimagined or reinterpreted to challenge and subvert these norms, offering opportunities for progressive social change.  
  
Suppressing Dissent: Your notion of ""eggsecution"" as a form of suppression of dissent is an intriguing metaphor. In any institution, mascots can become symbols of conformity. If dissenting voices are marginalized or ridiculed using the mascot as a tool or symbol, this raises serious concerns about freedom of expression and the health of the academic community. The role of mascots should be to unite, not to intimidate or suppress.  
  
Re-evaluating Mascot Representation: It's important for institutions like UCSC to continuously re-evaluate their symbols, including mascots, to ensure they align with current values and ideals. This includes an assessment of how these symbols are perceived and whether they inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes or practices. Engaging with diverse community voices in this evaluation process is crucial for a holistic understanding.  
  
Moving Forward: Finally, addressing these concerns requires a multi-faceted approach. This includes open dialogues within the UCSC community about the mascot's role and impact, educational initiatives to raise awareness about gender stereotypes, and possibly reimagining the mascot's portrayal to align with inclusive and progressive values. Such steps can transform the mascot from a symbol of contention into one of positive change and unity."

The bikes you see that are actually on campus are either paying extra for that privilege or just sending it. Btw I tried taking my plate off and TAPS ticketed me using my VIN lol. I'm not going to pay it anyway since there's some title murkiness with my bike and that ticket isn't going anywhere lol but for most people I'd say don't risk it."

I can't tell you how many times I've had people zip across right in front of me on Bay Street, forcing me to slam on my brakes as I'm coming down a steep grade, or how many obnoxiously large SUVs / Sprinter Vans driving 60 mph on High Street or Pacific while children are going to school.

i would just email and explain the situation, especially since COVID is typically a missing-multiple-classes type deal. speaking as a TA: most of the time, your TAs/profs are just worried about you dropping off the face of the planet for weeks with no notice. offer to make anything up if you’re worried about a grade, though i personally wouldn’t make my students make work up if they were out sick (and with covid, no less). hope your kid feels better soon, and hope you stay safe!"

As someone who graduated in the mid 2000s, it kinda blows my mind that a university that you are likely paying tens of thousands of dollars and possibly accumulating student loan debt to attend requires attendance as part of your grade.

You're an adult paying for your education. This is not high school. If you can turn in your assignments on time, get good grades on them and pass all your  exams, attendance should be irrelevant imo.

kigufkp,197q598,2024-01-18 10:12:13,Agree—the hardware concentration in CE is pretty much ideal for VLSI design.  You can supplement it with some analog and RF electronics if you want to get into mixed-signal chips.
ki24p6d,197q598,2024-01-15 17:37:49,then yeah ask your advisor on how to add on a double major
ki53hdj,197q598,2024-01-16 08:22:28,"My advice as someone who double majored, has worked in both semiconductors and software development, and is a hiring manager: just focus on one major and supplement with classes from other areas that are interesting, even if they don’t contribute to your degree (assuming you have the time to do this, which I assume you do if you’re considering a second major). Employers don’t really care about double majors, or even if you’re CS/CE/EE/CSE/EECS/etc. (They vary so widely from school to school anyway) They just care about what you’ve learned, what projects/experience you have with your skillset, and if you can articulate it. Just my 2¢, take what you may from it."

khw267u,196u0fk,2024-01-14 15:52:50,chat with your RA / housing office to see if you can get moved to another floor or building! if you can’t — it’ll be over before you know it. i kept to myself when living in the dorms and enjoyed the school a lot more once i moved out. <3
khxc78y,196u0fk,2024-01-14 20:55:25,"^^^ this

unfortunately, ur ra isn’t going to be able to force them to be respectful if they don’t want to be— just like how teachers in hs can’t force kids to stop being catty. it sucks, and im sorry that u got stuck with a floor with so many people like this on it. 

the only options i can think of from here: 

1) avoid the dorm. try to spend as much time in libraries, downtown, at friends’ floors/buildings/apts, etc. as u can. u will still feel the isolation, but it might help with the feeling of active disinclusion

2) room change!  U R NOT DUMB FOR WANTING A CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT, this would drive me insane i think ur so resilient for putting up with it for this long. ur ra seems like someone who will support you in the process, so definitely talk to them. 
at least in kresge dorms (might be diff if ur elsewhere), u fill out one form, and afterwards ur ra fills out a form from their end. collab / share responses / talk with ur ra to make sure things line up. talk about the impacts this is having on your mental health, how it’s making you unhappy with college, etc etc. 
to maximize your chances, select as many options for relocation as you can (triple, quad, stevenson, c9, kresge, select everything u would be ok with even if its not ideal) 

3) u also mentioned that u felt like u hadn’t made many friends on campus. ur not alone in this, it is quite difficult  especially if you can’t really start off with those beginning of quarter friendships with ur floormates. 
i don’t know if any of the following will work for you, so take it with a grain of salt. but its not too late to join clubs— u can find the main pages for pretty much all unofficial and official clubs on the discord student hub. 
downtown, there are open mic nights and trivia nights at 11th hour. it’s an even mix of students / working adults i feel, but the vibes are really nice. i think you could ask to join a team and most people would say yes. theres a mahjong club ive heard of, makers markets, farmers markets. 
in terms of events on campus, keep an eye out for events in other residential colleges! stevenson has an open mic night, kresge has a battle of the bands & also will have a lot of smaller individual floor events going on as the quarter progresses. these r usually more lowkey (a few people only), so its easier to actually talk and get to know people. 

idk if any of this will help but lmk if u have any questions or want to talk, ur so valid & im sorry ur going thru this :(("

khwvw7g,196u0fk,2024-01-14 18:59:40,Yea talk to your RA and see if you can get moved. One of my roommates got moved to my apartment cause of an uncomfortable situation. It’s not dumb and you don’t need to deal with their shit!!!

WHAT??? You are SERIOUSLY fucking up if you pay more off campus than on campus dude. I paid $2200/month, which is INSANE, for a Porter apartment double + dining hall costs. Now I pay $1400/month for my own, large room in a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house a few miles from campus. Even after I get groceries, and  factor in gas, my monthly expenses off campus are less than my rent ALONE for a double. And $1400 for a room is on the higher side...."

If u just want something to do on the weekends then join a club that interests you. Meeting people and making friends should be easier to do in college than any other time in your life so take advantage of the social resources that school provides. I was a transfer student and felt really out of place as a 21yr old living with basically high schoolers. They are petty and cliquey and they suck. I joined a club and basically never spent time in the dorms (Stevenson dorms suck anyways), made friends and moved off campus with them the next year. You still have plenty of time to turn your college experience around, best of luck!"

Another night I was talking with some girls about weed. I wanted to try using it to help my nerves and they reccomended going to a doctor and getting a medical card. I said, ""Or I could just... go buy some."" And they replied ""...you can do that?"" I hadn't realized I'd been talking to two 19-yr-olds!

Some discounts are available to extend your budget:

Thanks to collective bargaining from the academic student employee union (UC UAW 2865), all UC students, staff, and faculty have access to discounts on Dirwin, Lectric, Ride1Up, and Velotric ebikes. Note that these ebikes are sold primarily in a direct-to-consumer model, so you may have a hard time getting the electronics and motors of these bikes serviced locally. If you like tinkering and are not afraid to learn about maintaining and repairing your bike, then these may be a good option. (With the exception of the Ride1Up Prodigy v1 which has a mid-drive motor, these discounted ebikes are all rear hub motors.)

If you enjoy DIY, you can consider getting an ebike conversion kit. Most kits are between a couple hundred to under two thousand, but there are generally no rebates or incentives available for conversion kits. If you go this route, you'll be able to get a higher power motor than the ones on street-legal ebikes sold in stores. You will also have better self repairability and compatibility, as most name-brand motors (Bosch, Shimano STEPS, etc) are locked down and not easy to fix. I only recommend mid-drive motor kits due to the hilly Santa Cruz terrain. Bafang/8fun and CYC motors are two commonly used motor manufacturers that provide mid-drive motor kits. If you use Bafang, get their previous gen motors (BBS02 or BBSHD) since their newest ones (M-series) seem to going the Bosch route and will only work with Bafang-specific batteries.

Since you will be commuting on public roads, to remain street-legal you must limit the power of your motor to under 750W (through setting current limits in software). This only applies to custom kits, as nearly all store-bought ebikes are <=750W.

---

Whether you're new to riding or have experience, I'd recommend shopping for an ebike at a local bike shop. They can provide test rides and ensure a good fit for both your riding style and use case. If you decide to go for one of the direct-to-consumer ebikes, make sure you check the bike geometry specifications carefully (i.e. standover height) so that it is compatible with you."

khu4t7k,196jhgw,2024-01-14 09:10:31,"Khan academy was a huge help to me. I was in a similar boat, I took the calc AB AP test my junior year of high school in 2016, went to community college where I took no math, and then took calc 19B in winter of 2023. Yes, that is a 6 year gap between taking those classes. It was hard, and probably I spent a lot longer on homework than my peers did, but I made flashcards with the info from trigonometry/precalc/calc 1 that I had forgotten and needed to review on Khan academy, and then kept them handy while doing homework. then I made flashcards with the new concepts from calc 2 that I wanted to remember and kept those handy too. I was taking it asynchronously online so I could use those notes on exams, but if you're taking it synchronously and have closed-note exams I'd make flashcards and then quiz yourself as often as you can to really learn them. Going to LSS tutoring (remember they *also* have a math study hall which would be a great place to review calc 1 and older math topics), office hours, etc is a great plan and should set you up for success."
khuapdw,196jhgw,2024-01-14 09:44:14,Hey I’m taking math 11b this quarter too. Do you have tamanoi? You can dm me about specifics that you’re worried about. I tutored a lot of classmates last quarter and they did really well.
ki7ki1e,196jhgw,2024-01-16 16:44:16,"As others have said, Khan Academy and OChem tutor are both very useful resources with calculus. As a math tutor, I would like to emphasize some common mistakes that those who aren't as mathematically inclined and those who are both tend to struggle with.

My first piece of advice is, know your algebra. One thing you'll hear a lot about calculus is that the hardest part of it isn't the calculus concepts themselves, but the algebra behind them. If you have your algebra mastered, you should have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of every concept in calculus itself.

My second piece of advice is, write out every single step. I can't even remember how many times I've gotten a problem wrong because all that was missing was a single negative sign that was the only roadblock to a correct answer. I can recall when I was taking 23A, I was stuck on a hw problem for 3 days, in which I was doing everything right except I had forgotten a single negative sign in a long extensive calculation.

Third, trust but verify. On tests, if you have the time don't just submit the test early, go through as many problems as you can again to make sure that you're getting the exact same answers twice through. It will definitely create a solid portion of your test that you will confidently know is irrefutably correct and give you a lot of ease as you wait for scores to come out.

Finally, since you're taking 11B, you're going to be doing Taylor Series approximations. Always make sure that you have all the basic series memorized, how to simplify factorials, and make sure you have your derivatives down. These are likely going to be the biggest roadblocks from my experience. When you get to them, make sure you have your sin, cos, ln, and e\^x series memorized. Additionally try having a strong foundation on power series if possible.

I hope this helps and if you ever begin to struggle on any of the concepts, my services are open."

Also, reserving study rooms on the library websites a week in advance, every day… and using the time pressure to crank work out like mad. If you got a classmate to study with they can book the slot right after you then you can have a secure space all day. At S&E they’re not always the quietest, but they’ve great whiteboards. 

There’s the Baskin Eng computer labs

The “cubicles” on the third floor of McHenry aren’t always the quietest but usually pretty good.

Basically just claiming a spot early or later in the day worked for me. I hate loud and crowds. 

I would always go to Kresge Writing center for late nighters, nap on the couch under the stairs, then crank it out in the wee hours of the morning. 

Also, empty classrooms work well until at least 11pm if not 2am when the cleaning crews come by. We studied in the Interdisciplinary Science Building a lot until 2 am bc the libraries closed at midnight before COVID. Looks like they still close at midnight on weekdays. 

I found exercising, napping, and socializing during peak hours helped me enjoy campus while avoiding the loud crowds. 

You can always get a hammock with extra long straps and read between some redwoods (or on your deck if you have one) - on dry days. 

Stevenson library is also nice at night. 

There’s the Cowell lounge with the piano between the dining hall and the bathroom.

khrxp0a,1967lvz,2024-01-13 20:56:24,Page Smith Library is where it’s at
khrxr2i,1967lvz,2024-01-13 20:56:53,stevenson library is way better tbh
khsj8ti,1967lvz,2024-01-14 00:43:31,coolest layout too!
khs0w28,1967lvz,2024-01-13 21:24:14,Give us a rating / compilation list of all of em
khs1gmv,1967lvz,2024-01-13 21:29:26,Which place had the most and least dust? ( for someone who has asthma)
khsiaoo,1967lvz,2024-01-14 00:32:02,"Dude nuh uh there is no way you visited EVERY study spot. Every empty classroom? Every computer lab? Every little hidden alcove?

It's a beautiful world if you look in the right places and the same goes for good study spots."
kht712q,1967lvz,2024-01-14 05:18:30,Dude there are entire lecture halls and class rooms sitting empty 90% of the time. Engineering 2 has hall ways that are always empty and lounges and classrooms as well.
khu72ht,1967lvz,2024-01-14 09:23:24,"The lecture halls are booked solid all day, and many into the evening.  None of them are empty 90% of the time.  Some of the smaller classrooms are empty more often."
khs5poj,1967lvz,2024-01-13 22:10:14,Not even the silent study room 3rd floor of McHenry?
khryh91,1967lvz,2024-01-13 21:03:04,which is the most secluded
khsj9wi,1967lvz,2024-01-14 00:43:53,the treenet near the music center
khvbbov,1967lvz,2024-01-14 13:17:22,"The second floor of the ARC building was my favorite spot. Used to stay there until 5am studying. 

The janitor was supposed to kick us out but he asked that we turn the light off when we leave plus there’s a water fountain and bathroom down the hall from the study room"
khw2x9p,1967lvz,2024-01-14 15:57:20,"i live in kresge, and even i can’t get into any of the study lounges, since i don’t live in the new dorms. it’s incredibly frustrating walking by those lounges and seeing them all empty when i need a place to study."
khs4lgk,1967lvz,2024-01-13 21:59:12,You should’ve listed every spot
khuptyy,1967lvz,2024-01-14 11:11:06,The class rooms in jrl are always quiet. I used to study there until like 4am with no interruptions besides the janitors but they’re cool . You can look up which classrooms on the website
khuvjmh,1967lvz,2024-01-14 11:44:35,"The classrooms/conference rooms at the ERC area - by the career center/advising place are the most underrated study spots. Amah mutsun conference room, esselen nation room, etc can be reserved online, have a nice whiteboard, comfortable chairs, and a patio to relax in!"
khx6j9v,1967lvz,2024-01-14 20:11:13,They don’t kick you out at kresge writing center? Could be great to spend a night there for a commuter student
khxrryo,1967lvz,2024-01-14 23:24:29,"Campus security comes by to lock up and check your ID to make sure you’re a campus resident, or student at least. 

I didn’t pull all nighters regularly, so I don’t know if they’d take issue with a student trying to sleep there. When I said nap, I meant it. I’d sleep for no more thirty minutes or so."
khsb7oq,1967lvz,2024-01-13 23:08:58,I bet that would make the thesis writer's day to know someone read it and found it interesting 💜 🌟
khschu0,1967lvz,2024-01-13 23:23:31,It was old even when I was there. I wish I had got a copy of it!
khscsf6,1967lvz,2024-01-13 23:26:54,You should check it out.
khuwyrb,1967lvz,2024-01-14 11:52:51,whoaa never heard of this spot. is it in soc sci 1 or 2?
khv62hx,1967lvz,2024-01-14 12:46:26,"It's been ages and I don't remember which is which. The bigger one that has the computer and physical anthropology labs in it.

It was my favorite spot as a physical anthropology guy, and the wet lab and dry lab was just one floor up where I had most of my classes

Just attend lectures and at least make yourself familiar with the readings and you'll do fine.  It's actually much more straightforward of a course than other psych classes imo.

khptj1z,195wvy6,2024-01-13 12:40:42,honestly pretty easy to get a job on campus most in campus jobs completely let you choose not only when you work (because they cant give you work during class) but like what you want to work each week (max. 20 hrs). I used to do 20 hrs for my first two years on campus but now that im taking harder classes im only doing ten. remember to communicate w ur bosses to let them know if the work is too much or u want to work more. hope it helps! and like others said just apply everywhere and somewhere is bound to take you

There is an extensive UCSC oral history project that probably has a lot of good stories about how it came about and why it changed, that I bet you can have access to if you go to McHenry in person and talk to a librarian! 

I was a teaching assistant and in truth, the written evaluations reflected different levels of effort and achievement (excellent, very good, fair, poor) but they also included information about student participation in class discussions and even topics of projects and papers that they did. 

As a student, I definitely found it more relaxing than receiving letter grades."

khq7bbm,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:05:24,"When Bob Sinsheimer took over in 1980(?), he wanted UCSC to improve its academic profile. The university hired him because he kicked ass and took names and alienated a lot of the entrenched faculty. He phased in letter grades, eliminated a lot of classes that were famously laughable gut classes, and just generally tried to instill greater rigor into ""the hippie college""."
khqaa4f,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:23:16,"By ""entrenched faculty"" we mean at that time ""founding faculty"" who'd been teaching at this alternative university they'd helped create for only a few years at that point."
khqfz09,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:57:30,"More than a few years. UCSC opened in 1964. So about 16 years. Look, I was opposed to some of Sinsheimer's reforms at the time, but I know why he did them. In particular, as someone who later became a faculty member at a CSU campus, I can't imagine what a nightmare it was to have to get BOTH departmental approval AND college approval for each new hire. So if the sociology department wanted to hire a new tenure-track professor, they had to get both the sociology department and Stevenson College (I think; I think that's where sociology was housed) to agree. Dear God, it's enough hassle to try to get one department to agree on anything, let alone getting a bunch of other unrelated (and highly opinionated) faculty to cooperate."

 ""“Several of the things we projected in 1965 no longer occupy so prominent a place in the new Plan. Retired professors have played a prominent roil in the first five years; now most have gone and their places taken by regular appointees.”    


So if anything, Sinsheimer would have been replacing the sophomore crop of faculty.

khu3mp4,195m84i,2024-01-14 09:03:40,"The death of narrative evaluations, and complaints about them, were due to size growth in my opinion. As Wes noted, it got to a point where teachers and TA's were reverting to pre-written formulaic narratives in response to ever growing class sizes.    


Narratives were a part of the origin of UCSC. But in its origin, classes were tiny. In 1965-69, 50% of the classes had fewer than 16 students, and 85% had fewer than 31. But by the mid-70's, classes had grown considerably, at least introductory level lectures. Classroom Unit 2 with its 472 seats would be standing room only in some freshman level classes. Almost impossible for a professor to opine on that many students from a 10 week class.

Not always the case. I graduated from UCSC in '88, so I only had narrative evaluations. I went to grad school at UC Berkeley, and I was told by someone on the selection committee that I was literally the last person chosen for that year (in that department) because the committee members didn't want to have to go through the evaluations. 

Still, I preferred having narrative evaluations over letter grades, simply because you could get so much more detail about what you did well with and what you might have struggled with. I mean, what does ""A-"" mean?"

Well, those people should have seen the narrative evaluations given to my housemate, who did indeed flunk out. You think it's ugly seeing an F or a D on a report card? Try looking at entire paragraphs describing the various ways the student screwed up and got everything wrong. (My housemate was actually really depressed, and she went on to have a good, productive life even without a college degree. She flunked out before SSRI antidepressants were available.)

And the narrative evaluations varied dramatically in quality from one professor to another. I have one that literally just says ""This student got an 89 on the midterm and a 95 on the final."" Then I have others that go on at length about the strengths and weaknesses of my classroom performance. That was back when there were only 6,000 students in the whole university. You couldn't possibly have faculty and TAs write all the evaluations now.

Oh, and I still got into a good graduate program.

My guess is that most instructors don't even know this anymore, because UCSC stopped requiring narrative evaluations so long ago.

In particular, as someone who later became a faculty member at a CSU campus, I can't imagine what a nightmare it was to have to get BOTH departmental approval AND college approval for each new hire. So if the sociology department wanted to hire a new tenure-track professor, they had to get both the sociology department and Stevenson College (I think; I think that's where sociology was housed) to agree. Dear God, it's enough hassle to try to get one department to agree on anything, let alone getting a bunch of other unrelated (and highly opinionated) faculty to cooperate."

Narratives were a part of the origin of UCSC. But in its origin, classes were tiny. In 1965-69, 50% of the classes had fewer than 16 students, and 85% had fewer than 31. But by the mid-70's, classes had grown considerably, at least introductory level lectures. Classroom Unit 2 with its 472 seats would be standing room only in some freshman level classes. Almost impossible for a professor to opine on that many students from a 10 week class.

khpbuul,195m84i,2024-01-13 10:54:29,"Fun bit of trivia: You still can request narrative evaluations. When UCSC stopped requiring evaluations, they left open the option for teachers to still provide them on request. On your instructor's my.ucsc.edu portal, there is still a link to the page where evaluations can be posted and reviewed.

My guess is that most instructors don't even know this anymore, because UCSC stopped requiring narrative evaluations so long ago.

This clearly isn't well known, as I have had exactly one student request a narrative evaluation, and that was in Fall 2010 when we made the change."

khq7bbm,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:05:24,"When Bob Sinsheimer took over in 1980(?), he wanted UCSC to improve its academic profile. The university hired him because he kicked ass and took names and alienated a lot of the entrenched faculty. He phased in letter grades, eliminated a lot of classes that were famously laughable gut classes, and just generally tried to instill greater rigor into ""the hippie college""."
khqaa4f,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:23:16,"By ""entrenched faculty"" we mean at that time ""founding faculty"" who'd been teaching at this alternative university they'd helped create for only a few years at that point."

In particular, as someone who later became a faculty member at a CSU campus, I can't imagine what a nightmare it was to have to get BOTH departmental approval AND college approval for each new hire. So if the sociology department wanted to hire a new tenure-track professor, they had to get both the sociology department and Stevenson College (I think; I think that's where sociology was housed) to agree. Dear God, it's enough hassle to try to get one department to agree on anything, let alone getting a bunch of other unrelated (and highly opinionated) faculty to cooperate."

khol9di,195m84i,2024-01-13 08:17:02,"I was at UCSC from ‘99 to ‘04 and this is correct.  When I started narrative evals were the standard (though you could choose a letter grade) but by the time I left there had been a hard shift towards letter grades only.  The quality of the narrative eval also was super dependent on the program and professor.  The majority of my classes were in social sciences (Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology) and those professors tended to write very lengthy and detailed evals while my professors in Astronomy, Marine Science, Math, Econ, etc. would typically give maybe a sentence or two with your test, homework, lab, and participation scores listed.  I don’t know that I can say one way is better than the other but I do know that the narrative evals could cause headaches when applying for grad school (most programs really just wanted grades and not to be reading 30+ pages of evaluations)."
khq76d2,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:04:34,"These were both slippery slope solutions toward a grade-only policy. When I arrived in '88 it was narrative evals only. Then a few years later, the administration offered optional grades over the protests of students. A little later, it was grades mandatory and optional narratives. Then finally no more narrative evals and grades being the only option. The insightful students who protested the introduction of grades obviously saw the writing on the wall."
khuhqo3,195m84i,2024-01-14 10:24:19,"You say administration, but it was the faculty themselves, via the Academic Senate debates and vote, that narrative evaluations became letter grades. So imo, not a mandated decision foisted upon the faculty, but rather one they instigated and chose themselves."

khq8baf,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:11:26,I had the impression that some in the administration didn't like being viewed as a wacky hippy school that didn't have grades (even though that was part of the founding ideas).
khq9a7c,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:17:16,"Also, if students wanted to go to grad school, someone in administration had to translate the narrative evaluations to grades for the purposes of creating a GPA. It represented a lot of work, so TAs were encouraged to give cues, as LavJiang stated above. They literally wrote excellent, very good, fair, or poor on most evals, which meant that they kind of were giving grades anyway. It was easier to just work with the system than fight it, in the end."

khq8whl,195m84i,2024-01-13 14:14:59,Many students felt disadvantaged when applying to grad schools
khy8473,195m84i,2024-01-15 02:43:52,honestly after having attended UCSC for a few quarters I want to have it expunged from my record.
khu3mp4,195m84i,2024-01-14 09:03:40,"The death of narrative evaluations, and complaints about them, were due to size growth in my opinion. As Wes noted, it got to a point where teachers and TA's were reverting to pre-written formulaic narratives in response to ever growing class sizes.    


Narratives were a part of the origin of UCSC. But in its origin, classes were tiny. In 1965-69, 50% of the classes had fewer than 16 students, and 85% had fewer than 31. But by the mid-70's, classes had grown considerably, at least introductory level lectures. Classroom Unit 2 with its 472 seats would be standing room only in some freshman level classes. Almost impossible for a professor to opine on that many students from a 10 week class.  
Another good article with lots of detail:  https://planning.ucsc.edu/acad-planning/pdfs-images/archive-documents/70-80-acad-pln.pdf"
khpwjf3,195m84i,2024-01-13 12:59:16,"Yes, if they didn't have TAs to fob it off onto. But how much more work depended upon how detailed the instructor wanted to be. I received everything from a one partial-sentence evaluation to a two-page evaluation essay. It varied considerably, based on the instructors' preferences."

khs5xrm,195m84i,2024-01-13 22:12:35,"It was a bit more work. But I, and many other faculty, used scripts (Perl or Python) to convert grade spreadsheets into narratives. So I included (for example) class standing on exams and assignments."

khjwt92,1950cki,2024-01-12 10:28:48,"hi OP! this is in response to my post. first off, extremely wise words. i agree with what you said, and you’re right! i did want to point out a few things from reading the comments on this post though because i don’t think i was clear in my reason for posting. i mainly said what i said to vent and find community as i dont feel like a lot of people regret their choice, and my opinions are based solely on my experience and of course vary from person to person! the institution has a lot that’s wrong with it, as every school does, but my experience is based on my own life situations. im very much allowed to regret coming to this school and feel negatively towards my choice (not that you said im not). 

1) i commute to school and find it extremely difficult to attend classes (i am a full time student with a full time job) which i wasn’t expecting. SJSU is much closer to me in terms of commute so that alone would’ve helped a lot. i also have quite a few friends who go there and they enjoy it a lot! obviously my commute isn’t the institutions problem, it was my choice. i just didn’t realize how difficult it would be when i got in! 

2) im not lonely/depressed/don’t have friends at UCSC, i just overall feel like it is an environment (at least for my degree) where i am not truly learning much and there is little room for diversity in thinking. it 100% has something to do with my degree being psych, but knowing how UCSC’s student body is, i would’ve had a different experience at another campus (maybe not UC Berkeley..). i’m not planning to use my psych degree anymore because of my general displeasure for the psych community at the moment. 

3) the beauty of the campus is amazing! i absolutely find is gorgeous and that was actually one of the main reasons i wanted to go here. but in my time here, i’ve been to the beach once. i find myself extremely drained after classes and all i want to do is go home before traffic gets bad. but that’s just me, not the institutions fault. 

my opinions again are based on my personal experience and my lifestyle. many people agreed with me which was nice to hear. again, that’s what reddit is for! thank you for your post, it will help people who are struggling to find themselves and community! i just wanted to shed some light on why i posted what i did. best wishes to you! ❤️"
khjzzjt,1950cki,2024-01-12 10:46:17,If you are commuting to Santa Cruz from San Jose you are NOT getting the full UCSC experience. Hard to make college friends when you don’t live in the same town. Good luck out there.

khxwks4,195dkmn,2024-01-15 00:19:29,Yeah there’s a place in the health center to check your blood pressure which you need for the online thing. I’m pretty sure I always got it for free with school insurance and I used to the ring. I also think the plan b is free if you have school insurance
khmuaoi,195dkmn,2024-01-12 22:01:17,Isn’t it free now or did I dream that
khowyc6,195dkmn,2024-01-13 09:27:41,"If you have insurance, it will cover birth control pills for free (thanks Obamacare!).  You may still need to pay something for the doctor to write the prescription (the health center will do it for $25, your regular physician/gyno will do it as part of a regular visit), but you won't pay the pharmacy to get the actual pills."
khmsfe8,195dkmn,2024-01-12 21:42:55,You should be able to order it online. Nurx offers $15 rx or $0 with insurance. Just not Kaiser insurance.

khua4ha,195dkmn,2024-01-14 09:40:53,"in addition to what everyone else said, you can also look into planned parenthood direct! it’s this app where you can get birth control pills delivered to you within a couple days without having to go in-person to get a prescription. the only downside is that it’s pretty expensive if you don’t have the insurance that they take for this."

Edit. Or extend them across both lanes."

Thank goodness it was night (headlight time) and they weren’t driving an electric car. 

I always creep around those turns (and parking lots in general)?because you never know when someone is going to pull out our around the bend."
khkoxqu,1954rdm,2024-01-12 13:04:42,i think this problem would be resolved by only A/B permit holders driving there (as the garage states). the culprits of reckless driving are always R permit holders or permit-less.

khhr4gi,194pq36,2024-01-12 00:43:46,"Hey OP. I’m an alumni from awhile ago. I was also an RA for 3 years. Some years are harder than others and to be honest you can only do so much. Don’t think that you can solely make the situation better. Try a couple of times and if that doesn’t work forward the problem up the chain. If you try to shoulder making your housing unit perfect it’s only going to result in a lot of wasted energy. Being an Ra is not a career or lifestyle, you don’t owe the university or your residents more than observe, report, and explain.  If that doesn’t fix the problem than it’s your boss’s job. 

FYI the best part about being an RA is that years from now you end up with a lot less student debt than your friends and coworkers. While you are actually an RA it can seem super thankless. 

The reward of money saved compounds after you graduate. 

Best of luck and remember not to over extend yourself."
khjv427,194pq36,2024-01-12 10:19:30,Agreed. The only benefit of the job is the savings (housing + food covered). The rest of the job sucks ass

Keep the savings in mind. It’s an investment in your future more than anything else."

khkx5vn,194pq36,2024-01-12 13:51:34,My thoughts exactly. We are going to be seeing the aspects of how a year and a half of lockdown affected school-age kids for the next two decades
khl80z9,194pq36,2024-01-12 14:56:31,"You’re not gonna get immature dudes to shower, clean up after themselves, or do their laundry. You’re not their mother. It sucks that there are many many many immature people who go to our school who have yet to learn how to take out the trash. That’s something they will maybe learn later in life but you can only do what is expected of an RA and nothing more. And trust me, they aren’t disrespecting you because you’re a woman, most people like that have very little respect for ANYONE, obviously no respect for themselves."
khkwz9f,194pq36,2024-01-12 13:50:30,"I have a grade school teacher friend who has been observing the differences in how his classes since Covid were affected by a year and a half of lockdown. And because it happened at a different moment in their development, each class is broken in a different way. incoming Freshman experienced lockdown in the transition between middle school and high school. Do you think that accounts for some of their behavior problems?

Everyone was in such a hurry to get back to ""normal"" seems there was very little effort to understand how school-age children were affected by the pandemic"
khjurch,194pq36,2024-01-12 10:17:34,"hi, also RA here. yeah… residents definitely have gotten rowdier. if anything my only piece of advice would be getting strict on them, preferably as soon as possible. the longer they’re able to act as they want, the worse this is gonna get. if no, id bring this up to the CRE at your college to brainstorm ideas"
khmi7dq,194pq36,2024-01-12 20:13:22,"I did the job for 2 years while I went to school. 

I have to ask- are you enforcing policy? Do you do write ups? Bc some of these things, esp the yelling in the middle of the night, are policy violations and you don’t have to keep giving them warnings/reminders. Write them up when you hear it happening. Call a CSO to take care of it if you’re already in bed.  

As for hygiene/laundry there isn’t much you can do unless their roommates complain. Avoid that side of the hall as much as you can."
khoevfh,194pq36,2024-01-13 07:36:22,"You're not going to get them to do their laundry. If they finish college and still don't know how to they will likely be socially excluded from many circles. That will then force them to conform or suffer the social consequences.

You can, however, set house rules with clear consequences for not following them. 

Remember: you're dealing with 18 year old adult children, many of whom likely had absent parents at home. It's not your responsibility to be their parent."

UC Santa Cruz is part of a public research university system and has to meet the expectations of that system.

Yes, UCSC was established with a focus on undergraduate education, not necessarily as a research university, and even with high expectations that this would continue, later events changed the dynamic.

The election of Governor Ronald Reagan, Prop 13, and other things - especially the funding cuts of the 1970's and 80's.

There's an academic monograph published by UC Press that documents this.  There's also a book by an emeriti professor, and even an informal history written by a a retired College V (Porter) Proctor* that talks about the changes on campus.

These books can probably be found in McHenry if you're interested.  I'll try and find my copies to get the titles, but don't hold your breath.

*Proctors were the forerunners of the CSO's.  Usually assigned to one particular college as part of the staff.  They got to know the residents of the college pretty well.  I worked part-time as a Proctor when I was a student."

That was never the case—I think UCSC housed about 50% of students when they were at an enrollment of 6000.  There was no point to building more student housing than that, because students chose off-campus housing which was much cheaper—they sometimes had trouble filling the dorm spaces they had, because of the high cost necessitated paying off the bond debt for building the dorms."

UCOP should love this. It parallels their reasoning for dumping the SAT. Next logical step is to dump grades within the UC system. Because grades are basically racist.

Next step is to get rid of LSAT and MCAT. Bar exam, medical board exams too. For the same logic. URMs underperform. We should stop gathering data about this. We should stop using the tests. Then there will no longer be a performance gap. 

Further analysis will show that drivers tests, air traffic controller qualifications, jet pilots, class C truck drivers, are demographically skewed. To achieve equal outcomes, remove all standards and testing. Problem solved."

khhhfx2,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:53:08,"There is one thing I don’t like about UCSC. Compared to my old community college,

I don’t like how the college feels so disjointed. Like it feels **so lonely.**

Like there isn’t a unifying place where a lot of college students can just hang out/walk by like sproul plaza in uc Berkeley 

Yes I know it’s corny to want something like in the movies where a bunch of college students chill on grass, play frisbee, walk to class,etc in some campus center. But I’m corny I guess 


I didn’t really notice this on my campus tour. UCSC isn’t a huge regret in my life. But I did feel the energy at this college was a little dead/depressing at times 


Before anyone comments, I am aware of why UCSC was designed this way to avoid protests"
khirniw,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:33:06,The necessity for a unifying student hub is very real at UCSC. Having something like that available would undoubtably change the culture for the better. Imagine the tossing around a frisbee or slack-lining on a nice open space with views of both the ocean and the redwoods…
khn7g0p,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:31:36,"I'm apart of the slack crew. Hanging out at OPERS when it's nice is our version of a plaza. 

Now that it's rainy tho, it definitely can't feel lonely. ESPECIALLY if you are a junior transfer. Only a quarter to meet new people that you get along with is tough. 

It's layout has its ups and downs.

Fucking great if you like to walk around in the woods alone or with a hiking buddy or two tho"
khioyzx,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:15:19,"You know someone told me that is actually an intentional design of the school!  Back when UCSC was being heavily developed in the 60’s and 70’s Berkeley’s plaza’s were the sites of organization and protest.  The designers sought to avoid that at UCSC, and intentionally avoided designing a central quad/plaza meeting place."
khjd5op,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:40:48,"No, the intentional design is that the colleges were to be the focus of student life, academically and socially.  UCSC was going to be focused on undergraduate education, not necessarily on academic research like other UC's.

However, beginning in the 80's, the colleges were gutted, and replaced with a more ""traditional"" organization and focus of the university, to the detriment of the undergraduate experience."
khju6q9,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:14:27,The plaza at the new Kresge was supposed to be that. But I think it’s a bike parking lot mostly.
khj16wx,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:32:13,"So...back in my day? (class of '96) I think we didn't think much about the ""disjointed"" nature of the colleges...especially if you were a Cowell/Stevenson/Crown/Merrill student because EVERYONE (from those colleges) seemed to hang out on the East Field on a nice day.

I think a similar thing happened with Porter/Kresge/8/Oaks over at the Porter Meadow. (Or at least that's what we did over summer break as Porter dorms were where the summer housing was.)

I mean...there was word of expanding the student center even back then? But at the same time...most people really did just hang out with/at their colleges...But enrollment was teeny tiny compared with what you have now."
khkgtri,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:19:22,Yeah I feel like in order to love the campus you have to love how it’s immersed into the forest and they didn’t just clear a huge area of forest for the whole campus to be together. Makes things more inconvenient but is more beautiful

khhesjp,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:26:07,"speaking as a ~mature student~ it can be difficult, there’s definitely an echo chamber and unrealistic ideas of life/society/the world. the younger students/frosh can be especially close minded and entitled. 

friends are hard to find in that sort of environment so i’m sorry you’re dealing with that and the feelings of regret. just know that life outside of college exists and eventually you may even look back on your time in college with fondness (after you have to get a job with people that are also trying)"

khh9fzd,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:35:22,"nope, in the classes i’ve taken for my degree, most ppl seem to think the world is supposed to be some sort of “safe space” and are just overall entitled, rich white kids who want to cosplay being oppressed. i’ve taken poli sci classes and the atmosphere is SO different from psych."
khheq3q,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:25:27,"what major are you?

i have multiple fields of study and the vibes of people vary wildly amongst department. might be a social issue within your degree and not ucsc, is what im hypothesizing, because ive met wildly different types of people here"
khhf28x,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:28:50,it’s def the degree. i’m majoring in psychology. i mentioned in another comment that i’ve taken poli sci classes and the experience was much different. i guess because it’s my degree im around it way more often. i just know a large percentage of ucsc’s student body is similar in that way.
khhgjwq,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:44:00,"I'm also psychology. Though I don't think all psych people are like that, I can see what you mean, I also don't have many long-term friends from that major, because I found like-minded people from joining clubs/orgs. I'd try to join some to make your last few months here a bit more enjoyable"
khnkndt,194mckj,2024-01-13 03:17:03,did you enjoy your poli sci classes more? what would you say were the main differences between psych and poli students?
khpsflo,194mckj,2024-01-13 12:33:57,"i did enjoy the poli sci classes more because i felt like i was learning something valuable or new. with my psych classes everything felt repetitive, which a major focus on safe spaces and making sure we don’t hurt anyone’s feelings. that may work for some but it just wasn’t my cup of tea. also, psych professors tend to coddle their students a lot more and i think that makes for lower effort being given in the class."
khqj2mj,194mckj,2024-01-13 15:16:56,"That makes sense. I’m a poli sci major and my friend is a psych major. She says that in her experience, the demographic of psych classes tend to be white girls which leads to a “privileged perspective.” For the most part, my poli sci peers are generally understanding and have diverse perspectives especially if you stay in the major for longer considering that all of the course work we encounter gives us different perspectives."

khhcv4h,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:07:08,this is the realest thing i’ve ever read on the ucsc reddit
khh9sj3,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:38:27,Hollywood set some unrealistic expectations for college life.
khha9cu,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:42:39,"nah, this isn’t really about partying or anything. that’s not why i came here. more about morals/personality of the majority of our student body."
khhdgj1,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:12:57,"I've spent tons of time at UCLA, UCI, UCSC, UCSD & UCD.
  
With the exception of UCI, it really is all the same stuff."
khhkdbl,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:24:56,"just curious, what's different about uci?"
khiqqky,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:27:02,"Everything that has already been mentioned. Also, I noticed it has more international and wealthy students. I've never seen so many exotic cars in student parking."
khhn4yh,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:56:22,"UCI is much more of a commuter school so it doesn’t really have much campus life, on top of the fact that it attracts much more introverted students, and it’s situated in the middle of the most stereotypical suburb I’ve ever seen. Basically, everything about it is the opposite of what you think when you think “American university.”"
khhsgcg,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:00:12,Yes UCI is a such a commuter school
khjgy56,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:01:47,What do you mean by morals/personality?
khj3blg,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:44:37,"The whole of the student body? You mentioned in another comment that maybe it was more your major? 

Back when I was there this definitely influenced what my major was going to be. I don't know if it's the same anymore but in the late 80s-mid 90s say rather than just being an English Major you could drill it in to be Pre and Early Modern British/Modern British/Post blah blah blah/Latin American/European English etc...each their own major with their own requirements. And it was the same for most of the main subjects...and...yeah...

I knew I did not belong in a number of niche sections...even ones you'd think I'd be gung ho on because they were...well...my family history? Nope...not my people...especially not when you have to take all those required upper level classes with basically the same four or five students...you pay too much money for that bs.

I'm grateful I did eventually find my own niche? But as others have said? The crazy bubble-chamber that end up happening...it can get really disheartening if they are not the bubble you signed up for. Especially if you don't have the option in your major break off into a different sect anymore."
khhwi3c,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:50:25,"I regretted it, left, and now I’m SO MUCH HAPPIER"
khkdgqh,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:00:28,"Me too. I must miss UCSC on some level bc  I check in on this sub from time to time. Still have friends & relatives at the school. Spent a year at UCSC — realized the school has lots of institutional and cultural problems I could not see spending  3-4 more years struggling with. Moved on to another 4 year and am VERY happy I did. UCSC just wasn’t a good fit, it happens all the time."
khm9noe,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:08:47,where do you go now
khn0ux0,194mckj,2024-01-12 23:12:32,CSULB. I love it there
khjjrpu,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:17:28,"My only regrets about this school was not knowing how commuter unfriendly this school was. There's no parking anywhere except east remote lot. I'd still need to take the bus to get to class, so I just end up walking everywhere most of the time since the busses come every half hour at best."
khjxmu8,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:33:23,"yup, i’m a commuter student also. takes me about an hour to 1 1/2 to get to school, drains me pretty and and isn’t good for my gas."
khn7pmi,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:34:53,You can get them to pay for that I think
khpsjg6,194mckj,2024-01-13 12:34:38,i get FASFA thank god but with todays economy it doesn’t do much.
khmb089,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:18:35,"Same here, the commute is so rough & if you have a class that’s far from those lots good luck trying to get everywhere on time"
khh88x5,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:24:44,"I also regret coming here. You’re definitely not alone, although it does seem to be an uncommon sentiment with all the “most beautiful campus on earth” stuff.

I regret coming here because I don’t like the environment and the cost is astronomical. I’m paying tens of thousands of dollars to not have a good time. Feels bad, but at least I get my degree, which is the point of university in the first place."
khkejq2,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:06:34,"Hi! I think you and I had similar  conversations on this sub last year. Not loving UCSC might seem uncommon bc many of us who don’t like it, leave. Natural attrition. Not to march my choices around as better in any way, but I’m very curious, why did you end up staying? For me, leaving was the right choice, but I know not for everyone."
khw5j84,194mckj,2024-01-14 16:12:17,"Yes, I remember your comment! I ended up staying because 1) I met my girlfriend towards the end of my first year and 2) because I thought I’d be better off at a UC than CC, which was dumb in hindsight. The nail in the coffin, 3) it turned out I was on track to graduate a year early, but this reason was only like 15% of my decision.

My mindset was basically: “it will be a lot of effort and risk, and the benefit will be that I’ll have a slightly happier 8 months.”

I really commend you for taking the plunge and getting out of here. At least for me, that was an intimidating step that I never ended up taking. I’m glad to hear you’re happier!"
khhw8f4,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:47:08,i feel the same way and i’m also a psych major 😭
khhbbir,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:52:21,"Might have something to do with your major I’ve met some really really wonderful people in the economics, legal studies, and politics departments."
khhc47f,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:59:55,"oh yeah it’s def the major, psych lol."
khhtbxg,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:10:59,"Feel the same way, absolutely miserable here. There’s genuinely not one thing I like about this school and I regret not going to cc or somewhere else so much"
khkh4fl,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:21:02,"The earlier you start looking at options the better. If you want to go to another UC, my understanding is that it’s best to go to CC and TAG. Some might say give UCSC more time but in my case, one year was the tipping point."
khhcedh,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:02:37,"I felt the same for the first quarter(Fall 2022). I even had plans to transfer and took courses just to transfer, but changed my mind after seeing how much less stressful it was over here when getting opportunities. Helps that I had a solid friend group who I didn’t want to leave behind."
khhwiou,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:50:37,"Yeah, when I talk to ppl about school I tell them there is a honeymoon phase. The ""quirkiness"" of being in nature and being isolated is fun for a few months but after a while, it loses its shine. But as the years go by, a lot of the cons outweigh the benefits and it does not seem like the school is doing much until it is too late ie: the busses. 

People always say the academics are good and I do agree with that but for majors like CS and Engineering, I feel that most schools on our level offer the same level of rigor and experience. It baffles me though that there seems to be a lack of professors to teach classes in the CSE department. Obviously impacted majors will be difficult to get in but some classes with prereqs have 400 students and the next uppderdiv class only takes 100. So we are just going to assume that 300 students are going to fail? It doesn't make sense.

And on top of all that, it's not even like we are a sports school either where our funding goes to athletics. Even things like the tennis courts are run down and have not been serviceable for more than 2 years now. That honestly is super embarrassing and I couldn't imagine touring a school and seeing that the facilities are not even kept up. My high school and the community colleges near my house have better tennis courts which is pretty sad..."
khj913q,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:17:30,">It baffles me though that there seems to be a lack of professors to teach classes in the CSE department. 

Every university has that problem—with the enormous salaries that industry is paying for people with the skills, it is very difficult to get CS people to agree to teach for a fraction of the salary. 

It is made even more difficult by the huge classes and by the number of cheating incidents that results in. (Nothing disheartens professors more and drives them out of teaching faster than having students cheat and having to deal with the academic-integrity cases.)"
khjw8al,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:25:35,The housing market makes it hard to get the best instructors and staff with the salaries UCSC can pay.
khk1hqt,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:54:36,"True, the housing market makes it difficult to hire anyone, but CS faculty are difficult to hire anywhere in the US."
khjljra,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:27:14,"Also covid gutted all education of workers, lower and higher education across the board"
khjez04,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:50:52,Or perhaps some instructors are more concerned with students cheating than students learning and it's time for them to reexamine their pedagogy.

khm54jg,194mckj,2024-01-12 18:36:30,"Yeah, I regret coming to this school because I feel the same way as you about not fitting in. I wish that I went to a Cal State school instead."

khhct8y,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:06:38,omg the way i transferred here from a community college and now i’m trying to transfer back out to sjsu 😭😭 ucsc isn’t right for me
khhe53a,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:19:39,that’s literally my exact situation lmao i transferred from cc to ucsc was there for 1 quarter and didn’t fw it at all. thankfully sjsu does spring semester transfers so I didn’t have to waste too much time. if you’re thinking of transferring to a CSU just know there’s like two extra classes u have to take
khkggev,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:17:19,"Right, I’m at a CSU now and had to take a couple communications courses that are required GEs for transfer. Stayed home for a semester, worked full time at a paid internship, bought a car, took the classes for CSU transfer on CCC online and saved a BUNDLE not attending UCSC. Now that I’ve transferred, I’m on track to graduate with a CS degree in 3 years of college total (I had some CC dual enrollment and AP in HS). Sometimes leaving UCSC has so many checks in the plus column it’s the better decision."
khjvbol,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:20:38,SJSU is a great school. They have some strong areas of expertise.
khh9k19,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:36:23,god i should’ve done that ):
khh9qlv,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:37:59,yeah just didn’t like the vibes there at all. i have my orientation at sjsu tomorrow
khhhlkp,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:54:47,Well you’re a psych major so….
khhik0j,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:04:59,yup
khjd2yw,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:40:23,What were you expecting and what was your experience?
khl22yv,194mckj,2024-01-12 14:20:28,I felt the same way but I have an alright job now so it’s hard to find fault in what’s got me to where I’m at today. I think the main thing I regret is choosing UCSC because it ‘wasn’t a party school’. I was accepted to UCSB and chose UCSC because I felt like being in a party school would’ve been distracting. Now that I’m in my mid twenties I regret not taking advantage of it because it feels like I missed out on a formative social experience.
khl2ix6,194mckj,2024-01-12 14:23:07,I felt like I didn’t fit in after the first year but stuck around because changing schools felt intimidating
khms68s,194mckj,2024-01-12 21:40:30,"One of my close friends went to SJSU and HATED it. They went as a transfer and the advising was so terrible it was a struggle just to get admins to tell them what they needed to graduate. It got to a point they had 3 different admins telling them they had 3 completely different requirements and they had to escalate it to higher ups to get anything figured out. I can't say much about the people there in particular but they didn't meet anyone great and had some bad experiences (ex. meeting up w someone from an SJSU LGBT server to sell some charms n stuff and almost getting scammed).

fwiw when I was at ucsc I felt pretty out of place as well, I made like 2 friends in my 2 years there but I'm also pretty shy and bad at socializing. I was an out of state student though so the cost alone made me feel regretful."
khhpqpi,194mckj,2024-01-12 00:26:42,Many would agree with you out in the wild...
khhhtzt,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:57:15,"I was so angry and sad that i could not relate to anyone at all my first quarter. Everyone was white and asian. They were all in groups. went to the same hs/ms. Didnt seem like they wanted to talk to anyone that didnt look like them. they had hobbies like skiing or horseback riding. They talked about their multiple houses in the area. There was no actual reason to be upset, they were just really different from me and maybe i was mad i couldnt enjoy those luxuries. But i stopped thinking about, put my biases aside, and made friends. I don’t have many friends but i have some and im happy! i like the campus, environment, & classes. Ive seen white kids genuinely care and that means not all of them are the same entitled little shit. that puts me at peace😮‍💨🤣🤷‍♀️"
khjaohz,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:26:53,"""Everyone"" is a bit of an exaggeration. [https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-demand/enrollments.html](https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-demand/enrollments.html) gives statistics for campus.  If you add up white, Asian, and international students, you get about 66.7%, not ""everyone"".

Of course, different colleges have different mixes.  College 9 gets 72%, Oakes gets 51.3%."
khjnd9t,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:37:11,So they're the majority 🤔
khk19rj,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:53:21,"If you group Whites, Asians, and international students together, they form a majority.  No one group alone does at UCSC."
khhldkn,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:36:16,"I felt it was a good uni and program (anthro), there are plenty of sheep mentality types but I felt the city of SC does have something for everyone (personally more libertarian leaning and never had too much of an issue) since its one of the most liberal campuses though I can see why people would dog pile on others against their exact sentiments. Keep your head up the world is a big place."
khl74oq,194mckj,2024-01-12 14:51:01,I think most people with this mentality would probably not enjoy it any much more at another college. It comes down to what YOU make of it.
khmllwn,194mckj,2024-01-12 20:41:24,I graduated this year and also regret. I'm not wishing I've gone to another college though. My friends going to SJSU keep complaining about the school. Not sure about other campuses.
ki1og1g,194mckj,2024-01-15 15:59:27,"Transferred to SJSU for this exact reason, glad I’m not the only one that felt like this"
ki2jvzh,194mckj,2024-01-15 19:10:21,"Got this because I’ve been looking to transfer to the school, and lurking on reddit. I am trying to get out of UCSB as fast as possible. I feel like this culture is so much better than most UC’s to be honest"
khhpx27,194mckj,2024-01-12 00:28:50,"Even though I am a 4th year, with COVID it feels like my junior year tbh, and it sucks."

khm9bgy,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:06:24,in what ways do you feel like you don’t fit in
khirniw,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:33:06,The necessity for a unifying student hub is very real at UCSC. Having something like that available would undoubtably change the culture for the better. Imagine the tossing around a frisbee or slack-lining on a nice open space with views of both the ocean and the redwoods…
khn7g0p,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:31:36,"I'm apart of the slack crew. Hanging out at OPERS when it's nice is our version of a plaza. 

Now that it's rainy tho, it definitely can't feel lonely. ESPECIALLY if you are a junior transfer. Only a quarter to meet new people that you get along with is tough. 

It's layout has its ups and downs.

Fucking great if you like to walk around in the woods alone or with a hiking buddy or two tho"
khioyzx,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:15:19,"You know someone told me that is actually an intentional design of the school!  Back when UCSC was being heavily developed in the 60’s and 70’s Berkeley’s plaza’s were the sites of organization and protest.  The designers sought to avoid that at UCSC, and intentionally avoided designing a central quad/plaza meeting place."
khjd5op,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:40:48,"No, the intentional design is that the colleges were to be the focus of student life, academically and socially.  UCSC was going to be focused on undergraduate education, not necessarily on academic research like other UC's.

However, beginning in the 80's, the colleges were gutted, and replaced with a more ""traditional"" organization and focus of the university, to the detriment of the undergraduate experience."
khju6q9,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:14:27,The plaza at the new Kresge was supposed to be that. But I think it’s a bike parking lot mostly.
khj16wx,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:32:13,"So...back in my day? (class of '96) I think we didn't think much about the ""disjointed"" nature of the colleges...especially if you were a Cowell/Stevenson/Crown/Merrill student because EVERYONE (from those colleges) seemed to hang out on the East Field on a nice day.

I think a similar thing happened with Porter/Kresge/8/Oaks over at the Porter Meadow. (Or at least that's what we did over summer break as Porter dorms were where the summer housing was.)

I mean...there was word of expanding the student center even back then? But at the same time...most people really did just hang out with/at their colleges...But enrollment was teeny tiny compared with what you have now."
khkgtri,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:19:22,Yeah I feel like in order to love the campus you have to love how it’s immersed into the forest and they didn’t just clear a huge area of forest for the whole campus to be together. Makes things more inconvenient but is more beautiful
khh50mz,194mckj,2024-01-11 20:57:38,don’t rlly feel like my ideals/views align w most (no i am not republican)
khh7ox2,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:19:58,homestly ive felt the same way for a while even if most of the people are pretty welcoming i do think there is a bit of an echochamber with peoples morals and views being stated as objective truths
khh9hfv,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:35:44,yup. exactly.
khhesjp,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:26:07,"speaking as a ~mature student~ it can be difficult, there’s definitely an echo chamber and unrealistic ideas of life/society/the world. the younger students/frosh can be especially close minded and entitled. 

friends are hard to find in that sort of environment so i’m sorry you’re dealing with that and the feelings of regret. just know that life outside of college exists and eventually you may even look back on your time in college with fondness (after you have to get a job with people that are also trying)"
khjkp3g,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:22:35,"As another ~mature student~ who transferred here and has a lot of life experience outside of college, this comment is so so true. I’m grateful that the major I’m in has a lot less of this mindset and more focus around our curriculum, but I can’t imagine how difficult it could be finding friends in this environment."
khmao29,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:16:08,Damn I thought I was the only one. I’m a bit older and I don’t necessarily align with everyone else. I’m not sure if I like or dislike the loneliness yet lol
khhac3v,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:43:20,i also think part of it is a lot of people think that because of their beliefs they are a lot higher and better than others when they just have different prejudices and biases. also a lot of people have really big egos and lots of pride
khiw3y0,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:01:22,"that will go hand in hand with the moral truth point you made. Everyone is trying to be ""right"" so it creates those vertical relationships it seems"
khh552i,194mckj,2024-01-11 20:58:38,Is it like a thing where everyone drinks or smokes and you don’t?
khh9fzd,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:35:22,"nope, in the classes i’ve taken for my degree, most ppl seem to think the world is supposed to be some sort of “safe space” and are just overall entitled, rich white kids who want to cosplay being oppressed. i’ve taken poli sci classes and the atmosphere is SO different from psych."
khheq3q,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:25:27,"what major are you?

i have multiple fields of study and the vibes of people vary wildly amongst department. might be a social issue within your degree and not ucsc, is what im hypothesizing, because ive met wildly different types of people here"
khhf28x,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:28:50,it’s def the degree. i’m majoring in psychology. i mentioned in another comment that i’ve taken poli sci classes and the experience was much different. i guess because it’s my degree im around it way more often. i just know a large percentage of ucsc’s student body is similar in that way.
khhgjwq,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:44:00,"I'm also psychology. Though I don't think all psych people are like that, I can see what you mean, I also don't have many long-term friends from that major, because I found like-minded people from joining clubs/orgs. I'd try to join some to make your last few months here a bit more enjoyable"
khnkndt,194mckj,2024-01-13 03:17:03,did you enjoy your poli sci classes more? what would you say were the main differences between psych and poli students?
khpsflo,194mckj,2024-01-13 12:33:57,"i did enjoy the poli sci classes more because i felt like i was learning something valuable or new. with my psych classes everything felt repetitive, which a major focus on safe spaces and making sure we don’t hurt anyone’s feelings. that may work for some but it just wasn’t my cup of tea. also, psych professors tend to coddle their students a lot more and i think that makes for lower effort being given in the class."
khqj2mj,194mckj,2024-01-13 15:16:56,"That makes sense. I’m a poli sci major and my friend is a psych major. She says that in her experience, the demographic of psych classes tend to be white girls which leads to a “privileged perspective.” For the most part, my poli sci peers are generally understanding and have diverse perspectives especially if you stay in the major for longer considering that all of the course work we encounter gives us different perspectives."
khn7kj5,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:33:10,">(no i am not republican)

Hahahahahhahha"
khiwupy,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:06:01,Are republicans allowed to go there?
khjh8r6,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:03:25,Technically.
khha9cu,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:42:39,"nah, this isn’t really about partying or anything. that’s not why i came here. more about morals/personality of the majority of our student body."
khhdgj1,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:12:57,"I've spent tons of time at UCLA, UCI, UCSC, UCSD & UCD.
  
With the exception of UCI, it really is all the same stuff."
khhkdbl,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:24:56,"just curious, what's different about uci?"
khiqqky,194mckj,2024-01-12 06:27:02,"Everything that has already been mentioned. Also, I noticed it has more international and wealthy students. I've never seen so many exotic cars in student parking."
khhn4yh,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:56:22,"UCI is much more of a commuter school so it doesn’t really have much campus life, on top of the fact that it attracts much more introverted students, and it’s situated in the middle of the most stereotypical suburb I’ve ever seen. Basically, everything about it is the opposite of what you think when you think “American university.”"
khhsgcg,194mckj,2024-01-12 01:00:12,Yes UCI is a such a commuter school
khjgy56,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:01:47,What do you mean by morals/personality?
khj3blg,194mckj,2024-01-12 07:44:37,"The whole of the student body? You mentioned in another comment that maybe it was more your major? 

Back when I was there this definitely influenced what my major was going to be. I don't know if it's the same anymore but in the late 80s-mid 90s say rather than just being an English Major you could drill it in to be Pre and Early Modern British/Modern British/Post blah blah blah/Latin American/European English etc...each their own major with their own requirements. And it was the same for most of the main subjects...and...yeah...

I knew I did not belong in a number of niche sections...even ones you'd think I'd be gung ho on because they were...well...my family history? Nope...not my people...especially not when you have to take all those required upper level classes with basically the same four or five students...you pay too much money for that bs.

I'm grateful I did eventually find my own niche? But as others have said? The crazy bubble-chamber that end up happening...it can get really disheartening if they are not the bubble you signed up for. Especially if you don't have the option in your major break off into a different sect anymore."
khkdgqh,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:00:28,"Me too. I must miss UCSC on some level bc  I check in on this sub from time to time. Still have friends & relatives at the school. Spent a year at UCSC — realized the school has lots of institutional and cultural problems I could not see spending  3-4 more years struggling with. Moved on to another 4 year and am VERY happy I did. UCSC just wasn’t a good fit, it happens all the time."
khm9noe,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:08:47,where do you go now
khn0ux0,194mckj,2024-01-12 23:12:32,CSULB. I love it there
khjxmu8,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:33:23,"yup, i’m a commuter student also. takes me about an hour to 1 1/2 to get to school, drains me pretty and and isn’t good for my gas."
khn7pmi,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:34:53,You can get them to pay for that I think
khpsjg6,194mckj,2024-01-13 12:34:38,i get FASFA thank god but with todays economy it doesn’t do much.
khmb089,194mckj,2024-01-12 19:18:35,"Same here, the commute is so rough & if you have a class that’s far from those lots good luck trying to get everywhere on time"
khkejq2,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:06:34,"Hi! I think you and I had similar  conversations on this sub last year. Not loving UCSC might seem uncommon bc many of us who don’t like it, leave. Natural attrition. Not to march my choices around as better in any way, but I’m very curious, why did you end up staying? For me, leaving was the right choice, but I know not for everyone."
khw5j84,194mckj,2024-01-14 16:12:17,"Yes, I remember your comment! I ended up staying because 1) I met my girlfriend towards the end of my first year and 2) because I thought I’d be better off at a UC than CC, which was dumb in hindsight. The nail in the coffin, 3) it turned out I was on track to graduate a year early, but this reason was only like 15% of my decision.

My mindset was basically: “it will be a lot of effort and risk, and the benefit will be that I’ll have a slightly happier 8 months.”

I really commend you for taking the plunge and getting out of here. At least for me, that was an intimidating step that I never ended up taking. I’m glad to hear you’re happier!"
khhc47f,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:59:55,"oh yeah it’s def the major, psych lol."
khkh4fl,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:21:02,"The earlier you start looking at options the better. If you want to go to another UC, my understanding is that it’s best to go to CC and TAG. Some might say give UCSC more time but in my case, one year was the tipping point."
khj913q,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:17:30,">It baffles me though that there seems to be a lack of professors to teach classes in the CSE department. 

Every university has that problem—with the enormous salaries that industry is paying for people with the skills, it is very difficult to get CS people to agree to teach for a fraction of the salary. 

It is made even more difficult by the huge classes and by the number of cheating incidents that results in. (Nothing disheartens professors more and drives them out of teaching faster than having students cheat and having to deal with the academic-integrity cases.)"
khjw8al,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:25:35,The housing market makes it hard to get the best instructors and staff with the salaries UCSC can pay.
khk1hqt,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:54:36,"True, the housing market makes it difficult to hire anyone, but CS faculty are difficult to hire anywhere in the US."
khjljra,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:27:14,"Also covid gutted all education of workers, lower and higher education across the board"
khjez04,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:50:52,Or perhaps some instructors are more concerned with students cheating than students learning and it's time for them to reexamine their pedagogy.
khjg7b5,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:57:40,"The weather here doesn't help, especially coupled with the extremely shady trees, and the hyper crowded buses. In the spring/summer its great."
khhf6fm,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:30:01,"in the classes i’ve taken for my degree, most ppl seem to think the world is supposed to be some sort of “safe space” and are just overall entitled, rich white kids who want to cosplay being oppressed. i’ve taken poli sci classes and the atmosphere is SO different from psych."
khkhiih,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:23:14,"I agree & also with earlier comments about the vibe at UCSC being lonely and depressing. I had a constant feeling of despair being there, and Santa Cruz in general. Just wasn’t a fit."
khhct8y,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:06:38,omg the way i transferred here from a community college and now i’m trying to transfer back out to sjsu 😭😭 ucsc isn’t right for me
khhe53a,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:19:39,that’s literally my exact situation lmao i transferred from cc to ucsc was there for 1 quarter and didn’t fw it at all. thankfully sjsu does spring semester transfers so I didn’t have to waste too much time. if you’re thinking of transferring to a CSU just know there’s like two extra classes u have to take
khkggev,194mckj,2024-01-12 12:17:19,"Right, I’m at a CSU now and had to take a couple communications courses that are required GEs for transfer. Stayed home for a semester, worked full time at a paid internship, bought a car, took the classes for CSU transfer on CCC online and saved a BUNDLE not attending UCSC. Now that I’ve transferred, I’m on track to graduate with a CS degree in 3 years of college total (I had some CC dual enrollment and AP in HS). Sometimes leaving UCSC has so many checks in the plus column it’s the better decision."
khjvbol,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:20:38,SJSU is a great school. They have some strong areas of expertise.
khh9k19,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:36:23,god i should’ve done that ):
khh9qlv,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:37:59,yeah just didn’t like the vibes there at all. i have my orientation at sjsu tomorrow
khhik0j,194mckj,2024-01-11 23:04:59,yup
khjaohz,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:26:53,"""Everyone"" is a bit of an exaggeration. [https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-demand/enrollments.html](https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-demand/enrollments.html) gives statistics for campus.  If you add up white, Asian, and international students, you get about 66.7%, not ""everyone"".

Of course, different colleges have different mixes.  College 9 gets 72%, Oakes gets 51.3%."
khjnd9t,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:37:11,So they're the majority 🤔
khk19rj,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:53:21,"If you group Whites, Asians, and international students together, they form a majority.  No one group alone does at UCSC."
khkpevc,194mckj,2024-01-12 13:07:23,Same here atm. At least we got our whole lives ahead of us
khn7g0p,194mckj,2024-01-13 00:31:36,"I'm apart of the slack crew. Hanging out at OPERS when it's nice is our version of a plaza. 

Now that it's rainy tho, it definitely can't feel lonely. ESPECIALLY if you are a junior transfer. Only a quarter to meet new people that you get along with is tough. 

It's layout has its ups and downs.

Fucking great if you like to walk around in the woods alone or with a hiking buddy or two tho"
khjd5op,194mckj,2024-01-12 08:40:48,"No, the intentional design is that the colleges were to be the focus of student life, academically and socially.  UCSC was going to be focused on undergraduate education, not necessarily on academic research like other UC's.

However, beginning in the 80's, the colleges were gutted, and replaced with a more ""traditional"" organization and focus of the university, to the detriment of the undergraduate experience."
khju6q9,194mckj,2024-01-12 10:14:27,The plaza at the new Kresge was supposed to be that. But I think it’s a bike parking lot mostly.
khh7ox2,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:19:58,homestly ive felt the same way for a while even if most of the people are pretty welcoming i do think there is a bit of an echochamber with peoples morals and views being stated as objective truths
khh9hfv,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:35:44,yup. exactly.
khhesjp,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:26:07,"speaking as a ~mature student~ it can be difficult, there’s definitely an echo chamber and unrealistic ideas of life/society/the world. the younger students/frosh can be especially close minded and entitled. 

friends are hard to find in that sort of environment so i’m sorry you’re dealing with that and the feelings of regret. just know that life outside of college exists and eventually you may even look back on your time in college with fondness (after you have to get a job with people that are also trying)"
khjkp3g,194mckj,2024-01-12 09:22:35,"As another ~mature student~ who transferred here and has a lot of life experience outside of college, this comment is so so true.

khhac3v,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:43:20,i also think part of it is a lot of people think that because of their beliefs they are a lot higher and better than others when they just have different prejudices and biases. also a lot of people have really big egos and lots of pride

khh9fzd,194mckj,2024-01-11 21:35:22,"nope, in the classes i’ve taken for my degree, most ppl seem to think the world is supposed to be some sort of “safe space” and are just overall entitled, rich white kids who want to cosplay being oppressed. i’ve taken poli sci classes and the atmosphere is SO different from psych."
khheq3q,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:25:27,"what major are you?

i have multiple fields of study and the vibes of people vary wildly amongst department. might be a social issue within your degree and not ucsc, is what im hypothesizing, because ive met wildly different types of people here"
khhf28x,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:28:50,it’s def the degree. i’m majoring in psychology. i mentioned in another comment that i’ve taken poli sci classes and the experience was much different. i guess because it’s my degree im around it way more often. i just know a large percentage of ucsc’s student body is similar in that way.

Stayed home for a semester, worked full time at a paid internship, bought a car, took the classes for CSU transfer on CCC online and saved a BUNDLE not attending UCSC. Now that I’ve transferred, I’m on track to graduate with a CS degree in 3 years of college total (I had some CC dual enrollment and AP in HS). Sometimes leaving UCSC has so many checks in the plus column it’s the better decision."

khhesjp,194mckj,2024-01-11 22:26:07,"speaking as a ~mature student~ it can be difficult, there’s definitely an echo chamber and unrealistic ideas of life/society/the world. the younger students/frosh can be especially close minded and entitled. 

friends are hard to find in that sort of environment so i’m sorry you’re dealing with that and the feelings of regret. just know that life outside of college exists and eventually you may even look back on your time in college with fondness (after you have to get a job with people that are also trying)"

khmw8b5,195e4ej,2024-01-12 22:21:12,"I was once a straight male myself. I also succumbed to the gender norms until... First it started as a joke among friends, then it escalated. It was fine to make-out if we spoke the sacred words 'no-homo' beforehand. The other bros were drunk and curious, so they decided to join in. I mean, we are all bros, it's not strange if we have slumber parties. It gets hot sometimes with multiple straight males under a blanket. So clothes must be removed. 
Gayness is the solution to an epidemic of loneliness and the path to love that most bros wouldn't see otherwise. The bros and I have made it our mission to spread the love to all our fellow straight males on campus. The gayness won't be stopped, it can't stop, it's too late. Once they discover the joy of sharing a hot moment with another bro, they all crumble. If you're a straight female, introduce us to your boyfriend. If you don't have a boyfriend please cheer us on and celebrate our happiness. Thank you."

khig4qf,194qp1j,2024-01-12 05:11:59,"I’m not an expert, and didn’t get professional help for a bout of panic attacks, but I found a way to deal with them. Also PTSD, but no meds. I started to recognize them when they first came on. I said to myself, “you’re not dying, you’ve been thru this before and you know what it is”. Mine manifested in heart attacks, but obviously, I never had a heart attack nor died. Remind yourself right now that despite feeling like dying, you never have (I’m assuming, ha). Over time, just recognizing that overwhelming feeling of impending doom washing over you and then telling yourself, i know what this is, I’m not going to die and breathing and letting it pass thru you worked for me. “This is a panic attack. I’ve felt it before and lived thru it every time. I’m not going to die and it will be over soon.” Experts might say that this is ridiculous advice, but it worked for me. I had an attack driving in traffic once with my whole family in the car and managed to not wreck the car, which was an accomplishment. I also haven’t had one in more than 12 years after adopting this strategy. Maybe you can start this process once you start feeling Deja vu and tell yourself, “hey, I know what’s coming next”. 

I hope something eventually works for you; real panic attacks suck. And these days, everyone says they’re “having a panic attack” when they’re simply experiencing anxiety, but they have no idea. They’re scary."
khjliov,194qp1j,2024-01-12 09:27:04,Thanks for the advice! I will definitely try that
khjcu0m,194qp1j,2024-01-12 08:39:00,Might be worth checking with DRC and maybe CAPS for advice on how they might be able to give some accommodation for your situation in the classroom setting.
khjlpdu,194qp1j,2024-01-12 09:28:05,"I’ll look into that, especially if I have to take my medication since it somewhat acts like a tranquilizer and if I have to take it before class, then I’m not making it to class"
khkgbu7,194qp1j,2024-01-12 12:16:36,"Hey so sorry this is happening! I went through a physically and mentally traumatic event smack in the middle of college and it made sitting in class physically challenging because of the pain for the rest of my 4 years. Sometimes the bumps going over the train tracks on Laurel St. near 7/11 would make me cry when I rode the bus lol.

Anyway, u/noLeading-6909's advice is excellent! I would like to add that it is worth talking to your professors and TAs about this if you're comfortable. You certainly have formal recourse through DRC and so on, which I highly recommend, but going to an instructor after class and mentioning to them, as I did, ""hey I have neck pain so severe I can't focus so sometimes I need to step outside for a breath"" could be very effective. It certainly helped me feel less anxious about ""getting in trouble"" or whatever when I was already feeling bad in the moment.

All that being said, I hope you're able to feel better in the future and wish you the best!"

khqp92k,195pv5g,2024-01-13 15:55:23,Why would you want a partner that's that immature/shallow? You're looking for vulnerability in a way that's kind of not very masculine and throws up every red flag that you might have control issues.
khqq3lz,195pv5g,2024-01-13 16:00:36,I don't want an immature or shallow partner? Nor did I ever say I wanted one. Some people just like that kind of dynamic in a relationship. You can be mature and a full fleged human being with a whole personality your own and still want a traditional take care or your girl dynamic. I don't judge others for wanting similar or different things. Something isn't bad just because you don't personally want it.
khqebh1,195pv5g,2024-01-13 14:47:28,HMU if you are hot (jk) but in all seriousness it sounds like you want to have a Dom/Sub dynamic in your love life which is in line with your comment of ‘smol’. I would recommend asking woman you want to get serious with about it.

khqq9k1,195pv5g,2024-01-13 16:01:38,I mean not to get too personal but yeah I've been in those before and they are great when they are healthy. I guess my point is that it feels there's less people into that dynamic at UCSC than other places.
khsbrhn,195pv5g,2024-01-13 23:15:09,"Very interesting obseration… but imo as someone who falls into the “traditional feminine girlfriend” role (whatever this means to you) make sure you radiate the same energy at least. Do you pay for the first date? Do you initiate anything? Do you take off the mental load from her (as in are you thoughtful, plan ahead, and have common sense)? Do you establish yourself as a reliable stable man? There are stereotypes to the traditional heterosexual relationship that so many straight men crave. But a trend that I’ve noticed is that a lot of this is one sided in the way that many of those men don’t conform to the same trad standards they hold women to. Not accusing you of this but just food for thought."
khsco0z,195pv5g,2024-01-13 23:25:29,"See I agree completely. When someone says they want something but arnt willing to give it in return I don't think they deserved it in the first place. I personally like being my girls rock, someone she doesn't have to feel any obligation to act a certain way with. She can just be herself and we can just be ourselves without the feeling of expectation. I like to take initiative also and kind of make a path so that the people around me don't have to in my life, and that transfers over with my lady. So I at least can say that I'm doing what I feel is right in the moment and that usually leads to me automatically trying to take off her mental load and overall just wanting to make her life easier, as I find seeing someone you love relaxed and not worried or stressed makes me feel probably better than she does."
khsctx1,195pv5g,2024-01-13 23:27:23,"I also wouldn't say I'm the MOST traditional, like me and my girl are equal and it shouldn't be any other way. I know I shouldn't have to say that but I don't want this taken any way that it shouldn't be lol."
khovukd,195pv5g,2024-01-13 09:21:09,Horseshoe theory is in your favor. You'll find someone
khsa5ar,195pv5g,2024-01-13 22:57:05,"You absolutely can man, I found plenty of wholesome women who were more traditional at UCSC. Obviously this is a different time, but the women you’ll meet purely depends on the environment you put yourself in. 

Don’t expect to find a traditional woman at a bar, forest party, or any other degenerate party atmosphere. 

Join clubs on campus, meet girls in your classes, go to the rec rooms (theres so many), these are place where you’ll find a lot more level headed women. Ask yourself, if you were a woman with more traditional values where would you spend your time, how would you find a guy, where would you want to meet that guy.

On top of this though let me just say don’t focus much on “Finding a traditional woman” focus more on making friends that fall under your perspectives on life, and learn to filter out those who’ll make your life more miserable. 

The more you make good friends and meet people with rational and healthy perspectives on the world, the more you’ll come into contact with a good potential partner. 

But either way hope this helps."

khg45ln,194buio,2024-01-11 16:44:33,No they definitely do harass you. I had to walk by them a several times in a day (for an unrelated reason) and they were extremely loud and forceful and even followed me ahead even after I repeatedly told them I am not a US citizen and cannot sign.

So it made me think the gaming industry was paying them."

khlo2fa,194mpxo,2024-01-12 16:40:19,"One sweet hike that will take your mind off school is Fall Creek.  You park in the lot off Felton Empire Road (it's a bit hard to spot) - head down to the creek and take the trail along the creek to the left.  When you get to the fork where the other creek comes in and the little bridge, go right and follow the creek until the trail leaves it on the left bank and head back toward the limekilns.  From there it's a straight shot back to the little bridge following the other creek.

khgu9c1,194hrgt,2024-01-11 19:35:43,"Depends on what you are plugging into the strip. Probably ok unless you are plugging in a heater, air conditioner, refrigerator, or big ass computer and display. Most strips have circuit breakers that will protect against too much current being drawn."
khji6ii,194g1sr,2024-01-12 09:08:38,"As someone who has taken both (ENVS and Agroecology double-major), the capstone class is way easier but the seminar is more interesting/engaging. 

The capstone class is essentially a ""how to find a job"" class where you make a mock cover letter, resume, etc. If you've had a job before, it is useless since you'll have probably already done those things. It also has you read this career advice book on how to start job searches, that it's ok to not get a job right away in your field, etc, etc.

The seminar class will vary depending on the professor you take it with and the topic, but I really enjoyed mine! I took on that aligned with my interests about environmental justice and was pleasently suprised. The professor is more of a guiding force and you work with your peers to create a project that suits you, your group, and the class. Again, the content and curriculum is highly dependent on the professor you take it with. 

Overall, I found the capstone class to be a waste of time and the seminar to be one of the better ENVS classes I've taken."
khk5god,194g1sr,2024-01-12 11:16:32,"Thank you so much for the insight, this is very helpful! I’m glancing over old syllabus for capstone. It says there is an individual and group projects/presentations? Do you recall what they were on?"
khk9lzf,194g1sr,2024-01-12 11:39:15,"For the individual project, you just pick an environmental topic you want to write an essay on and then you're put in groups based on theme (animals, ocean, agroecology, etc). The group presentation is just each person in your theme-group taking turns presenting a 5-min powerpoint on what their paper was about. I think the paper only had to be 5-7 pages in length.

I don't know if I explained that well, but for example I chose to do my paper on how anthropogenic noise impacts bioacoustic species in urban environments. Since my paper was based around animals, I was grouped with 2 other people who also wrote about animal conservation. You don't actually work on your paper with them or anything, you just talk a few times and join your individual powerpoint slides together for the ""group"" presentation. The different papers don't have to relate to one another other than the overall theme.

One more thing about the senior seminar that I enjoyed was how everyone in that class wanted to be there. Since you have to apply for the seminars, everyone is really interested in the topic and enthusiastic about the course. The capstone class seemed like it was for the ""C's get degrees"" crowd tbh.

khkct45,194g1sr,2024-01-12 11:56:51,"Thanks so much!! If you don’t mind me asking, which professor did you take seminar with and what was the topic of the class? :) I know the seminar class size is typically small, but how big was the capstone?

Also for capstone: were there no individual presentations then? Only the single group one on your meshed topics?"
khkfe5v,194g1sr,2024-01-12 12:11:19,"Yeah no individual presentations for the capstone. Just a group presentation where you individually present your part of the slide show. My professor for is was Adam French, but I think Katie Monsen is teaching it this upcoming Spring quarter. I want to say there was around 30-40+ people in the class while my seminar class only had around 15 people"
khk5god,194g1sr,2024-01-12 11:16:32,"Thank you so much for the insight, this is very helpful! I’m glancing over old syllabus for capstone. It says there is an individual and group projects/presentations? Do you recall what they were on?"
khk9lzf,194g1sr,2024-01-12 11:39:15,"For the individual project, you just pick an environmental topic you want to write an essay on and then you're put in groups based on theme (animals, ocean, agroecology, etc). The group presentation is just each person in your theme-group taking turns presenting a 5-min powerpoint on what their paper was about. I think the paper only had to be 5-7 pages in length.

I don't know if I explained that well, but for example I chose to do my paper on how anthropogenic noise impacts bioacoustic species in urban environments. Since my paper was based around animals, I was grouped with 2 other people who also wrote about animal conservation. You don't actually work on your paper with them or anything, you just talk a few times and join your individual powerpoint slides together for the ""group"" presentation. The different papers don't have to relate to one another other than the overall theme.

One more thing about the senior seminar that I enjoyed was how everyone in that class wanted to be there.

I minored in bioinformatics since I had most of the requirements and had to stay a couple quarters anyways.  It's far more important to network and do research or an internship.  I'd only do it if the extra courses are valuable for your career and you can get some hands-on experience."

She gave us a prompt too. There was a slightly longer essay, if I’m remembering correctly, for the midterm. Then the final was a collaborative PowerPoint and essay about the theme of the class and how the books we read connected to it. Also we met the author of one of the books and we got to meet her and the university paid for lunch downtown for that meeting so it was pretty chill. I got a 96% in the class

kh9ruo5,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:55:40,from the first lecture it seems like 107 is like discrete math. Is this true?
kh9zp48,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:39:51,I did 131 but it started off with some discrete math concepts but then moves over to some probability theory stuff later on.

kha0yh1,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:47:03,I started in tantalo 107 and felt like I learned nothing and went to stat 131 and it started off strong then fell off around week 6. So tbh they are both pretty bad but at least 131 starts off semi strong.
kh9zjkn,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:38:59,"I was in both and they were both quite bad to be honest. 107 with tantalo was too abstract and tried to cover too much in short time and tried to cover stat131 week 4 topics in week 1 or 2. (Bayes theorem in week 1). Hyun started off fine but then fell off dramatically around week 6. If I were to do it again I would do 131 because the way tantalo was teaching I would have learned nothing at all whereas topics in 131 made sense for the first few weeks. 

Also regarding multivariable it shows up around week 7 in 131. The calculus is the easy part the hard part is the actual probability theory stuff and this is from somebody who didn't find 23A or 19B a breeze."
kha22cr,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:53:20,Do you have any information on how Parker is as a professor? I'm in Hyun right now and he seems ok but it seems like there's a lot of bad dislike for his STAT131.

Since he doesn't have any rmp reviews ig people didn't hate his class enough to make a posting so I'd check it out.   


I don't think hyun's 131 will get better unless he restructures how he teaches the class which is unlikely."

I heard 131 was hell with hyun. Idk about parker tho"
kha8kyc,193hoci,2024-01-10 15:32:53,idk I felt like 107 was a bit of a cram at the start as he tried doing bayes theorem in weeks 1-2 when we did that week 4 in 131.
khewslq,193hoci,2024-01-11 12:24:48,"he's trying to give people their money's worth. I've talked to him about this and it makes sense.

What tends to scare people is how hard the homework is, but people don't persist in asking questions (bar one but that's another story). He's more than willing to help if you just asked. 

Honestly, his office hours were where it was at when I took the class."
khf51bx,193hoci,2024-01-11 13:10:35,I tried 107 and the lectures just didn't work for me even and half the time I didn't know what to ask or how to start. Me personally I would much rather learn the class through the lecture than office hours.
kif12qy,193hoci,2024-01-18 02:24:49,"While that works for some classes, you're eventually gonna hit a roadblock. I hit that in 
107, 120 and AM114. Office hours help a lot. Especially for Tantalo classes since he does guide students to the answer. 

As for what to ask, if some equation or derivation or hw problem doesn't make sense, start there. If you have zero clue, you have to say that. Most professors would be willing to either guide you through the problem or guide you to resources for you to figure it out."
kh9utq3,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:12:27,the average on my classes 131 final was 50% lol
kha0o9u,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:45:26,on our 131 midterm it was 23 percent then the prof turned off grade calculations and hid all the scores.
kh9mql3,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:27:48,"Avoid Sangwon Hyun if you can help it. Class is terribly structured, the midterm and final barely resemble anything he told us to study, completely opaque homework grading policy, and you have no idea what your grade in the class is until grades are submitted after the quarter is over."
kh9rxvr,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:56:10,"I heard this too, if i was to switch into 131 I would take parker"
kha121c,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:47:37,can vouch for this too the lectures were way too abstract and didn't really connect to the homework much and there wasn't really any good advice to prepare for any exams.
kh98vo9,193hoci,2024-01-10 12:12:00,the teachers will expect you to know multi and will spend very little time if any reviewing it
kh9sea9,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:58:42,"I did do multivariable calculus in AM 30, but I did poorly so I was still deciding whether sticking with 107 is better since everyone says tantalo is bad for 107 even though he is good for 101."
khc4v8b,193hoci,2024-01-11 00:21:35,"107 with Tantalo is honestly not bad at all and I might even say it was enjoyable but that is just me I might be crazy. The homework is way harder than the exams, but you just go to section to get help with it and do some review of basic concepts and you should be mega fine. Also Tantalo is very generous with partial credit. If you write out the basic steps for a specific type of problem even if the actual math is wrong you will probably get at least half points."
kh9apxa,193hoci,2024-01-10 12:22:06,"Multivariable calc is not a prereq for 131, if that helps make your decision"
kh9s35a,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:56:58,"Yes, I have heard this but it seems like multivariable content is still in the class"
kicjtet,193hoci,2024-01-17 14:23:32,"I am currently in STAT 131 with Parker and the class seems to be okay. However, you need to print out your notes beforehand because you will fill it out and use them on recap quizzes. Recap quizzes are done in class before every lecture and utilize information from the notes. The class so far has been fair and he seems to be a good lecturer. The only issue is that it is at 8 AM. If you can deal with that, I think it will be okay for you."

What tends to scare people is how hard the homework is, but people don't persist in asking questions (bar one but that's another story). He's more than willing to help if you just asked. 

Honestly, his office hours were where it was at when I took the class."
khf51bx,193hoci,2024-01-11 13:10:35,I tried 107 and the lectures just didn't work for me even and half the time I didn't know what to ask or how to start. Me personally I would much rather learn the class through the lecture than office hours.
kif12qy,193hoci,2024-01-18 02:24:49,"While that works for some classes, you're eventually gonna hit a roadblock. I hit that in 
107, 120 and AM114. Office hours help a lot. Especially for Tantalo classes since he does guide students to the answer. 

As for what to ask, if some equation or derivation or hw problem doesn't make sense, start there. If you have zero clue, you have to say that. Most professors would be willing to either guide you through the problem or guide you to resources for you to figure it out."
kha0o9u,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:45:26,on our 131 midterm it was 23 percent then the prof turned off grade calculations and hid all the scores.
kh9rxvr,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:56:10,"I heard this too, if i was to switch into 131 I would take parker"
kha121c,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:47:37,can vouch for this too the lectures were way too abstract and didn't really connect to the homework much and there wasn't really any good advice to prepare for any exams.
kh9sea9,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:58:42,"I did do multivariable calculus in AM 30, but I did poorly so I was still deciding whether sticking with 107 is better since everyone says tantalo is bad for 107 even though he is good for 101."
kh9s35a,193hoci,2024-01-10 13:56:58,"Yes, I have heard this but it seems like multivariable content is still in the class"
kh9zp48,193hoci,2024-01-10 14:39:51,I did 131 but it started off with some discrete math concepts but then moves over to some probability theory stuff later on.
kha4kbn,193hoci,2024-01-10 15:08:11,Yes!
khb49f3,193hoci,2024-01-10 18:54:49,"well discrete math covers basic probability and stats, but 107 has a lot more"
kha3yj6,193hoci,2024-01-10 15:04:34,"tbh I don't know anybody personally who had him as he joined about 3 years ago around 2021. I would personally check out his class to see how it's going and perhaps transfer in. Since he doesn't have any rmp reviews ig people didn't hate his class enough to make a posting so I'd check it out.   


I don't think hyun's 131 will get better unless he restructures how he teaches the class which is unlikely."
kha52rb,193hoci,2024-01-10 15:11:18,"Probably will play it safe and swap to Parker as it seems like Hyun is a very controversial professor, thanks for the help!"
kha7xz7,193hoci,2024-01-10 15:28:52,Yea I'd do that as well if I could. I feel like I only did kind of decent in 131 was because he decided to throw us a bone at the end so the whole class doesn't walk out with a F.

kh97ve4,193eghk,2024-01-10 12:06:23,I think that there were a few classes that were accidentally scheduled in rooms that had a max capacity less than the class size so they had to shuffle things around.
kh8mi6n,193eghk,2024-01-10 10:09:03,happened to one of my peers

khdz4qx,193j6lk,2024-01-11 09:18:31,I would reach out to transit they have a lost and found.

kh9topd,193jww6,2024-01-10 14:05:59,"yeah it’s possible, just look at the requirements for the physics minor on the physics page. 

i am CE and used to be declared as a physics minor but i switched over to an EE minor. i am not sure where you got the info that you can’t be an EE minor if you’re CE."
khab5pn,193jww6,2024-01-10 15:49:08,I am CE and I did a minor in both CS and EE. Wherever you got that info from was completely wrong.

kh3uak0,192ofmt,2024-01-09 12:48:28,Im taking a night class and its not my first. Not a fan of how late it gets but i dont feel too unsafe being on campus. I know things do happen unfortunately and people get assaulted but like others have mentioned walk with a friend or even use the safe ride program if you feel its needed. Personally i recommend carrying pepper spray for worst case scenario but i think overall campus is relatively safe.

kh41d82,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:27:02,This^ very useful
kh3sw6w,192ofmt,2024-01-09 12:40:52,Try to find someone in your class who also parks at east remote to walk with you? Like through a class discord or something
kh41ahm,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:26:37,"Okay, this was decades ago but…I used to close McHenry Library at 11:30 pm as a Sophomore. I know I was super naive…but I thought nothing of walking through all the forested shortcuts back to Cowell. I never felt unsafe. Maybe it was the false sense of security that it was campus? Enrollment was only 8-9 k students…it was super unusual to see anyone on the road or trails. 

So…with the explosion of student population at 17k…is it really still that empty? I used to walk home from Downtown Seattle to the Capitol Hill neighborhood in WA state and it was among a gaggle of people…I know a city vs campus comparison…but you can’t be the only person trekking to East remote….right? Maybe? 

Good luck. I really do want to believe the incidents you describe are bizarre one-offs."
kh4q1id,192ofmt,2024-01-09 15:49:43,When it starts to get dark and especially at night it’s definitely eerily quiet at least on the walk to east remote. It’s definitely a weird contrast from the busy-ness during the day and a little unnerving for sure
kh6bmu2,192ofmt,2024-01-09 22:49:41,"When I was at UCSC, there were only about 5500 students (early 80’s). Campus felt totally safe and serene all night long. Even the transient (Steve) that lived in the woods was cool. Back in those days though if you didn’t feel safe walking across campus back to your dorm late at night, you could call UCPD and a cop would come get you and give you a ride."
kh6hxbk,192ofmt,2024-01-10 00:00:44,"OP I had another thought after sharing your concern with another alum. Are the parking lots 24 hour now or are they restricted only during business hours? I was reminded about how a friend of ours would drive from remote to Merrill C lot to go to a night class. (There was no 9 or 10 then, but if your class is further in I’m guessing they also have C lots? I’m assuming that is what you mean by upper campus? Walking from your class to the closest c lot might be more well-lit and populated…that is, if the lots are still only restricted during the day and your class begins late enough?"
khayyy2,192ofmt,2024-01-10 18:20:25,"I’m pretty sure East & West remote are the only 24hour lots. Then a majority of the other lots require certain permits or become available to all after 8pm. My classes start before that & end a bit later than that so I’m kinda screwed. There’s a few park mobile options but people jump on those spots immediately so they aren’t reliable. I’m not familiar with C lots, probably need a permit for those? Not sure"
khbho9b,192ofmt,2024-01-10 20:31:21,"C-lots were “College” lots. They were the lots located at the main/driving entrances to the colleges. I have no idea now if these permits still exist given the increased number of students and new buildings. They were super limited as you were competing for spaces with faculty and more expensive as they put you closer to your college. 

Yeah…the lots only required permits during the day…if they’ve extended them to 8pm that blows that idea."
khbon5g,192ofmt,2024-01-10 21:29:22,"Yeah they definitely don’t make it easy. The east & west remote permits are outrageous. I want to say that the college lots you’re referring to require a specific type of permit that most people can’t get, then there’s a few park mobile spots (like 3-8 spots maybe) in most of those college lots but it’s an absolute joke. Just like you mentioned, it’s a war zone to compete for a spot between tons of students & staff"
kh4dior,192ofmt,2024-01-09 14:34:52,"Just call non-emergency line for ucsc police, they’re ucsc police student ambassadors that will pick you up and drop you off in a marked vehicle. You’re good 👍🏼 last pick up is usually before 12:30AM unless it has changed."

kh4hyzc,192ofmt,2024-01-09 15:00:50,^ same. I used to live in the village and would walk home
kh3rmn5,192ofmt,2024-01-09 12:34:02,I would say to find a buddy to walk with. There is bound to be someone else that is heading in the same direction as you!
kh48xo7,192ofmt,2024-01-09 14:08:48,"i left mchenry a bit before midnight for a good chunk of last quarter and its quite spooky but nothing has happened. Maybe you’ll see a student here and there but its not too bad. I tend to avoid areas that dont have much light. i carry pepper spray and this alarm thing! it def helps to not feel so frightened. If i felt really uncomfy, i would get on a call with my friend until i got to my dorm or i would order a saferide. Please look into saferide,,they’re great :) !!! i will say that upper campus feels 100x more safer than any part of the campus!"
kh4wtkt,192ofmt,2024-01-09 16:31:40,"If you feel uncomfortable, please don't call a friend while walking. And don't walk with earbuds in. You need to be -- and appear -- alert, aware of your surroundings, and not distracted. Distracted people are easier to surprise. Saferide is a much better alternative."
kh4zmzr,192ofmt,2024-01-09 16:49:20,aur i dont have the energy to talk while im in the call but still!! ty ill keep this in mind :) and yes saferide >>>>>
kh3zl3z,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:17:21,"Take this with a grain of salt (as a man) but I’ve walked alone at all hours of the night around campus and have never felt unsafe. Taking the shortcuts is a little more sketch but stick to the main roads and you’ll be fine. Upper campus is definitely safer as well, but if you’re really concerned you can make sure to walk by libraries or rooms you can quickly dip into. I don’t know if this is still a thing but there used to be a night shuttle you can call to safely drop you off around campus as well. Be alert and stay safe!"
kh44lpm,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:44:51,"dunno, they coyotes are somewhat unnerving late at night.  There's also the mountain lions.

But yeah, this campus appears to have way less crime than I would have assumed."
kh4i9zg,192ofmt,2024-01-09 15:02:41,Is there any recorded attack by a mountain lion or coyote?
kh5exon,192ofmt,2024-01-09 18:27:48,No this is unfounded fear-mongering.
kh7tlxx,192ofmt,2024-01-10 07:26:27,"They didn't say you're going to be attacked by them, just that they can be unnerving.

Which is true, seeing a pack of coyotes howling at midnight when you're by yourself in the dark is pretty scary even though they're more afraid of you"
kh5q9fq,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:45:21,"I’ve been stalked by them a couple times before, but they usually just leave you be if you get loud and appear reasonably threatening."
kh4thxz,192ofmt,2024-01-09 16:11:09,"On campus?  i doubt it.  In general?  Yes.

humans are kind of large for coyotes normal predation, though they will attack humans if desperate.  The ones near campus have an abundance of deer to eat, since there's no wolves near here.  WRT mountain lions, they're here but relatively uncommon."
kh59z68,192ofmt,2024-01-09 17:55:20,I meant on campus
kh8l6zs,192ofmt,2024-01-10 10:01:50,"honest question:  do you think the animals recognize the campus as a ""no attack humans"" zone?

I don't think so.  If animals with history and potential to attack humans are on campus, the potential for an attack on campus exists.  Sitting back and saying ""it hasn't happened thus far, so it won't happen"" is a rather brazen displacy of complacency.

I'm not saying anything with regard to behavior, or trying to stoke fears.  Both concerns (coyotes and mountain lions) are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things (as compared to, say, cars)."
khc803g,192ofmt,2024-01-11 01:01:04,"lol I have a literal pack of coyotes that lives and hunts on my property. I chase them off regularly because I don’t want them around my cat. As for mountain lions, I know they watch me so I’ll often carry a metal pole when I’m walking around at night between houses. It’s not fun finding a deer dismembered 100 ft from my bedroom door in very clean pieces. 
And yes animals will act different around campus where they interact with humans much more often than let’s say on my property. There should be less attacks at UCSC where the animals will avoid large groups of people making noise."
khcds1i,192ofmt,2024-01-11 02:14:52,"Coyotes *have* attacked humans.  It's a rare event, certainly, but it *has* happened.  It's unlikely *here*, given the abundance of deer--a more appropriate prey for them--but *not* impossible.

>the animals will avoid large groups of people making noise.

A: The whole premise of this thread is walking *alone* at night.  B: most animals that become more familiar with humans become *more likely* to attack humans."
khcv0nk,192ofmt,2024-01-11 05:09:07,"Which leads us back to my original question,
A. Would a mountain lion come close enough to campus where people walking alone are a risk? 
B. Don’t feed the coyotes, some idiot started feeding them in my neighborhood and someone had to send out an email: fed coyote = dead coyote."
khgscmv,192ofmt,2024-01-11 19:22:18,"Huh?   There's been plenty of mountain lion sightings on campus.  There was a mountain lion cub sighted just outside grad student housing last year.  Ground floor apartment, it was photographed just outside the banister, early in the morning.  Where there's a cub, there's a momma nearby.

They certainly *are* here."
khh0vco,192ofmt,2024-01-11 20:24:45,"Makes sense, so basically nothing to worry about"
kh453lb,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:47:36,"FWIW, [pepper spray](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/weapons-prohibited-on-campus.pdf) is allowed for self defense."
kh5m34n,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:15:48,Skunks in the garbage cans are more of a problem than coyotes or mountain lions.
kh52zc9,192ofmt,2024-01-09 17:10:33,I'm a dude and I bike everywhere so I'm not sure if that changes anything but I've never felt unsafe. I stay later on campus and go about around 11PM-1AM and typically there's no people anyways and I've never felt like I was in danger or anything. I know the saferide service exists but I'm always out and about on campus around 11PM-1AM and I've never encountered anybody or felt unsafe.
kh5e16r,192ofmt,2024-01-09 18:21:52,Get a nice flashlight. Like 500 plus lumens. Really helps you feel more comfortable. But also remember it is actually a very safe campus even at night.
kh6bpy6,192ofmt,2024-01-09 22:50:36,"after a certain time TAPS stops checking lots to ticket. usually i just park anywhere after 7, there’s only been two times in my four years here that i got a ticket after 7. FYI"
kh5t8by,192ofmt,2024-01-09 20:07:11,"So I don’t wanna dismiss your concerns or anything. But I would like to point out that the r*pe that was reported recently was after a party. The victim was found unconscious and intoxicated. I don’t want to downplay it at all. That’s not my intention. But I just want to point out that you won’t be leaving class in a condition that would be similar. Maybe that eases your mind, maybe it doesn’t. I’m not sure, but I hope that might help. As far as the woman that was detained a year ago, I can’t say I’ve heard of that case and I can’t seem to find anything about it, so I can’t try to ease your mind about that.

Outside of that, carry some pepper spray, get a bright flashlight, if you can make a friend in that class that can walk with you. I’m assuming your class ends at like 7 or 8. As long as it ends before 10, you can catch a bus to East remote with some reliability. That should make your walk a lot shorter and a lot safer. Finally, remember that most men are relatively harmless. They can be rude, and maybe make you a little uncomfortable, but most of them don’t have any desire to harm you. Do with that what you will, but if you do try to make a friend in class to walk with you, a man might be a safe bet."
kh486cj,192ofmt,2024-01-09 14:04:33,I’ve walked from mchenry to c9 at 2 am and it was fine lol
kh4ud9p,192ofmt,2024-01-09 16:16:34,"I’ve walked from the lab at Baskin to Crown at 3 AM  once and it was fine. I live off campus now and take the bus, but I carry my pepper spray and my roommates have my location for safety reasons. A lot of my engineering courses have been scheduled late in the evenings so I do what I can"
kh5ouw6,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:35:18,"Thank you everyone for your input, stories, and advice. Much appreciated. Just didn’t really know what to expect on campus at night. I definitely plan on having pepper spray and a good flashlight on me at all times just to be sure."
kh6ji6l,192ofmt,2024-01-10 00:19:40,"Yea it’s not as bad as it seems. My friends at San Jose state and at UC Berkeley tell me that just about every day they get text messages and notifications about a robbery or assault or something and they get used to it. The fact that we have so little incidents is honestly kind of surprising but considering that nobody really comes up onto campus other than students kind of makes sense. 

Anyways just be aware of your surroundings and that’s all you really need to do I’ve never had any trouble waking about late at night and rarely see other students going about as well."
kh48oe4,192ofmt,2024-01-09 14:07:21,i took night classes almost every quarter and it never was a problem
kh4a6vu,192ofmt,2024-01-09 14:15:54,"I carry pepper spray with me 24/7 no matter where I go, I’d say get one off of Amazon mine was abt $10. I’m taking a night class for the first time too and I agree it’s hella dark and creepy. On top of the spray I recommend a safety alarm and maybe a small knife (ucsc says as long as the folding knife is less than 2.5 inches and has only 1 sharp edge and can’t be opened automatically it’s allowed)"
kh4uagr,192ofmt,2024-01-09 16:16:05,"i'm skeptical of the utility of a knife in a self-defense situation unless you actually know what you're doing.  By all means carry one because they're generally useful, but I don't think it'll be the effective deterrent that your post might suggest."
kh5d6e9,192ofmt,2024-01-09 18:16:17,"i took a lot of night classes and i was fine, maybe try to find someone else in the class who could walk with you?"
kh5pz9t,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:43:17,"I am also taking my first night classes and am a little daunted but them, but have had to walk across campus alone before. I think the campus here is pretty safe— unlike other colleges that are right next to the city, it’s pretty isolated, meaning you’ll have a smaller chance of running into somebody sketchy. That, of course, does not mean such a circumstance is impossible, or that every college student is completely trustworthy, either, but it’s certainly on the safer end. Just keep your wits about you, walk near well-lit areas or catch the bus, call somebody as you walk, don’t meander for too long in the dark, carry proper spray, and pay attention. Chances are you’ll be fine, but it never hurts to be safe."
kh6jpmd,192ofmt,2024-01-10 00:22:09,Yea the location must be something as well I know people at SJSU and Berkeley tell me that they get emails and text message alerts about robberies and attacks just about every day but here it’s very rare to get those alerts.
kh6nu34,192ofmt,2024-01-10 01:13:42,"Same here, and part of the reason why I didn’t end up going to Berkeley. It’s nestled right in the middle of a city with a few spots of pretty high crime rate, and unfortunately a lot of that ends up seeping into the campus."
kh5qby7,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:45:51,haha i got surrounded by 3 coyotes the other day on my walk back from my shift.. i was probably dramatic but so scared haha. i've been walking with a knife and pepper spray since. that was the first incident that's ever happened to me here and i technically lived so you should be fine. just make sure you have some sort of plan
kh60vw8,192ofmt,2024-01-09 21:08:16,"Yikes. How did you respond, what caused them to back off?"

kh8s50e,192ofmt,2024-01-10 10:40:12,"Non-emergency incidents, public service requests or inquiries: (831) 459-2231."
kh6aiwp,192ofmt,2024-01-09 22:38:10,if your class starts at or after 8pm you can park at the lots nearby if it doesn’t require a 24/7 permit (i.e ADA)
kh6fetw,192ofmt,2024-01-09 23:31:26,"If you're perchance talking about a Monday night class, I did the walk from Hahn Student Services to Science Hill last night for BIO 130. It felt darker than I remember from 2021. Back then, I thought of it as peaceful and meditative; with a nice view of the stars sometimes. Now, I just think of how out of shape my calves are, and that I'm bringing a headlight the next non-MLK Monday.

After 8:30pm, most lots can be parked in without permits. After I think 4:30, R permits can park at Hahn Student Services, and NC can park in several places. Then you don't have to walk as far. Taking a bus may feel more secure, and even at night there's usually more than one person waiting at the popular stops."
kh6jqpu,192ofmt,2024-01-10 00:22:31,"If the loop is still running after your class, you can just take it to east remote. I've done that after some late classes to avoid walking all the way to east remote from baskin (in my case it was more me being too lazy to walk than being concerned for safety)."
kh3s8cu,192ofmt,2024-01-09 12:37:20,"If you can, I'd recommend having someone drop you off as close to the classroom and pick you up as well."
kh4001x,192ofmt,2024-01-09 13:19:37,"Was about to comment something similar to an above comment. As a dude, I never felt unsafe. And as far as I can remember, my more feminine counterparts never did either. You'll be fine. Campus is safe and just stick to the main roads with lights."
kh5nz72,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:29:01,"The upper campus is safe. But always use the buddy system and be aware of your surroundings. UCSC Dispatch needs to be in your favorites 831-459-2231. No one will be mad if you call 911 either, but I believe it doesn’t connect to UCSC PD."
kh5qdsi,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:46:14,"Walk on the main pathways, find a buddy in your class to walk with, and use the busses! Safe ride is also always an option."
kh5rn6y,192ofmt,2024-01-09 19:55:25,"I’ve taken classes that have had me stay entire nights on campus and walked/biked around high street at 2-3 AM.

Suffice to say Santa Cruz is pretty safe as long as you aren’t  in the shadier spots like downtown by the river. And even then I’ve walked in those areas at 10 PM with bags of booze and groceries with no problem. 

If the worry is still an issue then the school does offer ride services for those who request it. 

Tl;dr Night time classes are normal from my point of view. I’ve had them in both community college and at other colleges. And also experienced college life at places with higher rates of crime. As long as you aren’t weirdly brandishing high value items that could be stolen, you’ll be fine."
kh6s0bc,192ofmt,2024-01-10 02:06:45,Maybe consider using an e-bike to expedite your commute
kh6tx2b,192ofmt,2024-01-10 02:30:21,"My best advice is make a friend in the class, even as a dude it was scary for me at first, and I’m quite tall, big, you get the point but it just feels uneasy at times. Just make a friend in the class make sure they’re not a weirdo and walk with them, make plans to meet up with them before and after classes that way you walk with them and not alone, bonus if they have a parking pass because you can park around some places close to classes after 5!!"

kh4q1id,192ofmt,2024-01-09 15:49:43,When it starts to get dark and especially at night it’s definitely eerily quiet at least on the walk to east remote. It’s definitely a weird contrast from the busy-ness during the day and a little unnerving for sure
kh6bmu2,192ofmt,2024-01-09 22:49:41,"When I was at UCSC, there were only about 5500 students (early 80’s). Campus felt totally safe and serene all night long. Even the transient (Steve) that lived in the woods was cool. Back in those days though if you didn’t feel safe walking across campus back to your dorm late at night, you could call UCPD and a cop would come get you and give you a ride."
kh6hxbk,192ofmt,2024-01-10 00:00:44,"OP I had another thought after sharing your concern with another alum. Are the parking lots 24 hour now or are they restricted only during business hours?

I don't think so.  If animals with history and potential to attack humans are on campus, the potential for an attack on campus exists.  Sitting back and saying ""it hasn't happened thus far, so it won't happen"" is a rather brazen displacy of complacency.

I'm not saying anything with regard to behavior, or trying to stoke fears.  Both concerns (coyotes and mountain lions) are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things (as compared to, say, cars)."

It’s not fun finding a deer dismembered 100 ft from my bedroom door in very clean pieces.

My friends at San Jose state and at UC Berkeley tell me that just about every day they get text messages and notifications about a robbery or assault or something and they get used to it. The fact that we have so little incidents is honestly kind of surprising but considering that nobody really comes up onto campus other than students kind of makes sense. 

Anyways just be aware of your surroundings and that’s all you really need to do I’ve never had any trouble waking about late at night and rarely see other students going about as well."

I have no idea now if these permits still exist given the increased number of students and new buildings. They were super limited as you were competing for spaces with faculty and more expensive as they put you closer to your college. 

Yeah…the lots only required permits during the day…if they’ve extended them to 8pm that blows that idea."

kh4ph57,192rtah,2024-01-09 15:46:15,"Neuro has very little psych adjacent content. Really the only psych we talk about is when we discuss higher order cognition in neuro classes. The neuro degree has bio, chem, ochem, biochem, and physics if you are down for that. Unfortunately, the neuro major is really small right now so there are only 3 classes, 1 lab, and 1 seminar. The rest of the classes are the same that you would take in the MCD bio major. Also, you won't take any neuro classes until your third year because there are so many prereqs.

The best thing you can do is plan out your schedule early so you can see what your four years will look like. you can also add the double major later, and focus on CE for now while taking a couple of neuro pre-reqs on the side to see if it is a good fit. I'm actually in my fourth year just now declaring neuro so there is definitely time to figure things out."
kh4qtnh,192rtah,2024-01-09 15:54:29,Also regarding your question - it is absolutely possible to do this double major. What matters is that neuro is a good fit for you and that you have a good plan. I would talk with your advisor about it and I'd also reach out to MCD advising.

kh5ah54,192rtah,2024-01-09 17:58:34,You could maybe try physics. Physicists often work in the computational side of neuroscience and probably has more over lab with ur CE curriculum

kh4mjzj,192rtah,2024-01-09 15:28:33,i mean it's def doable in 3-4 years but also keep in mind that the neuro degree is just an mcd bio degree + neuroscience elective classes. I'm also curious what parts of neuroscience interest you if you don't mind
kh5gpdx,192rtah,2024-01-09 18:39:28,CE alone is barely doable in 4 years. Most take 5.

kh4qtnh,192rtah,2024-01-09 15:54:29,Also regarding your question - it is absolutely possible to do this double major. What matters is that neuro is a good fit for you and that you have a good plan. I would talk with your advisor about it and I'd also reach out to MCD advising.

kh68rbi,192rtah,2024-01-09 22:20:28,"According to [https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-outcomes/avg-time-to-degree.html](https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-outcomes/avg-time-to-degree.html) the average time to degree for computer engineering is 4.29 years (so one extra quarter, not an extra year).  And that is ""elapsed years""—for ""enrolled years"" the number is slightly less, at 4.23 years.  EE is the slowest major on campus, at 4.47 enrolled years."

Not only are they still at it with trying to set up oil rigs and plants right next to schools, but now they’re trying to pass off attempts to reduce the minimum wage under everything ranging from saving the sea turtles to providing more opportunities to disabled children. Always keep in mind that the people running those petitions are always being paid by a another body— usually some corporation— to hold them.

That doesn’t mean that there isn’t the ocasional student held petition for the school that is, indeed, legitimate; just make sure that you read all of the fine print and are 100% sure of every single thing you put your name on"

kh5rk8d,192wjek,2024-01-09 19:54:49,"It seems pretty early to make judgments about the class - you haven’t even gotten into the content or discussions yet. I’d say give it a chance - you feeling “out of place” can actually be a good thing, as you might learn something new. College is a great time to get out of your comfort zone and understand others’ perspectives more clearly."
kh61qo2,192wjek,2024-01-09 21:15:42,"I’m transfeminine, but I was still closeted when I started taking intro feminism and was still masculine presenting at the time, so I can relate to your feeling of being out of place/not belonging in such a female dominated environment. But I do not think that’s a good enough reason to quit the class. 

I took intro feminism in the second quarter of my freshman year, and it enlightened me in so many ways. I thought feminist women hated men, but it turns out feminism benefits us all in the long run. Feminism is about fighting for equality for everyone. Just think of this class as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Because that’s what intersectional feminism does. It provides a set of mental tools to analyze and resist inequality.

What I learned in that intro feminism class is what allowed me to better understand myself enough so that I could eventually begin to transition. Thankfully, at UCSC, feminism is almost always intersectional, so definitely stay in it. 🙂👍🏼 

Intersectional feminism is about promoting a world where people are free to flourish into their own authentic, unique selves, independent of rigid binary gender roles. 

People are skeptical of feminism because the dominant narrative in society is that feminism is anti-male. While it is true that some feminist women are unironically misandrist, they shouldn’t be used to smear the rest of us good intersectional positive feminists. Most feminist women are pretty chill once you get to know them. They just want equal rights. 

Also, I found the initial readings that we were assigned in my intro feminism class to be very hard to follow because it was packed with feminist terminology and feminist theories I hadn’t been educated on yet. Maybe this is why you want to drop the class. If so, just give it another week and see if the concepts start making sense. It seems intimidating at first, but just hang in there and try your best.

At the end of the day, it is up to you, but just remember, classes like this are intimidating because they require the mental courage to deconstruct your own identities."

>*You shouldn't shrive for ""equity"" it's ridiculous to expect equality of outcome, but go for equality of opportunity and the idea of meritocracy. P.S. Idealogy =/= Demographic.*

Dear Campus Community,  
Welcome back to campus, and thank you for your patience over the past month as we made temporary changes to Campus Transit following the Dec. 12 bus crash. We expect to return to normal operation levels over the coming weeks. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department, with assistance from the California Highway Patrol, is continuing to actively investigate the cause of the crash.  
Out of an abundance of caution, we took our 35-foot buses out of service to conduct additional off-cycle inspections. We also asked the CHP’s Commercial Motor Carrier Safety Unit to inspect these buses, and that process is ongoing. We’ll be undertaking independent third-party inspections of all of our 30-foot buses as well, and will return them to service once that process is finished.  
Providing safe and reliable transportation service is a campus priority. Our bus fleet undergoes routine and regular maintenance as well as pre-trip inspections. As part of our normal process, the bus fleet also undergoes regular inspections by the CHP.  
As the 35-foot buses clear the CHP inspection process, we are bringing them back into service. It is possible that riders will experience transit delays until that process concludes in the next week or so. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.  
Sincerely,  
Ed  
Ed Reiskin  
Vice Chancellor, Finance, Operations and Administration"

kgznz1y,191s3e6,2024-01-08 18:01:47,do you know the difference between astr 1 and 2?
kh0leci,191s3e6,2024-01-08 21:58:08,I only took 3 but I think Astr 1 is easier(less math). Astr3 only had simple logarithms and exponentials and maybe some trig. The math wasn't super important though iirc

kgztny4,191uv71,2024-01-08 18:37:07,"That is unusually high.  Grades soared during the pandemic (rampant uncaught cheating, probably), but the pre-pandemic DFW rate was about 19%, not 38%.  There are many possible explanations for a high failure rate:

* students not properly prepared by prereqs.
* large numbers caught cheating
* grading standards unusually strict
* assessments not aligned with the instruction
* …

I have no idea what the situation was for Math 11B."
kh128fp,191uv71,2024-01-09 01:09:14,"Passed it with a C, that shit was rough but the TAs were amazing so take advantage"
kh131rc,191uv71,2024-01-09 01:19:47,Just BARELY passed that class with a C. I think a big reason there were so many bad grades is that a lot of people just started taking in person tests again last year after doing everything online. (I won’t elaborate on why people are more successful online but it probably comes from having your phone next to you.) He has a policy that if you score under 40% on the final you are automatically capped at a C- which also fucked some people over.
kh3zpz1,191uv71,2024-01-09 13:18:05,Barely passed that damn class last quarter. Still surprised I did honestly. Such a nightmare taking that class with him

kgv41ra,191djny,2024-01-07 23:25:43,"They don’t call it “You see sexy calves” for no reason. 😉

The Merrill hill by way of the road really isn’t that bad. I had 8 gears and did it on the first try while out of shape. I found going up the bike path way more of a challenge (from the West side cliffs to Kresge). 

If you ride up Empire Grade or Coolidge Dr., after Bay, it’s a little longer but it’s way less of an incline, so it’s easier to do without walking and pushing. 

If all else fails, just walk it and push. 

Practice going from downtown up through Nearie Lagoon to Bay and keep your eyes on the furthest tree ahead you can see once you get to the part on bay with all the trees and the center walking path. By the time you get to the big tree at the bend, you’ll be on pretty level ground again. I chant “1,2,1,2,1,2…” and it takes just a couple minutes.

There’s a bus from the next intersection after the incline and straight away if you want to give yourself a reprieve. 

The best part is taking the bike path down and finally being able to haul your groceries back up in paneers/saddle bags without having to get off and push. It just takes practice.

Have fun at UC Sexy Calves! 

Welcome to the club."

You do need low gears, though—a flatlander bike with only medium or high gears is not suitable for UCSC.

I do have to warn people that the downhill bike path is not that safe—the bend just above the Farm has one of the highest rates of transport-to-hospital of any place on campus.  It is a bit better than it was in March 2000, when I crashed my bike on that curve, breaking some of my ribs in back and splattering my spleen.  They straightened the curve out a little and removed the trees on the outside of the curve, but it is still not banked for coasting speed—they refused to engineer it for the speeds actually observed.  

So I ride up the bike path, but I don't ride down the bike path usually—it is much safer to take Hagar or Coolidge downhill, and it adds very little time to the downhill ride."
kgvatjz,191djny,2024-01-08 00:35:50,"im obese and i can do it. its not fast, but i can do it without standing while pedaling. you just need practice and you can do anything. 

to practice i just forced myself to bike up from off campus via bay street to lower campus 4x/week and eventually it got easier and easier. now i can bike from off campus to science hill. you just have to intentionally practice. if you live on campus, ride your bike off campus and try climbing back up on bay. take your time. or bike to lower campus and try to bike back up coolidge which is a slightly less difficult hill. you can do this!

edit: you can also just bike up mini-hills on campus. if you get better at smaller climbs it can help you feel more comfortable with and build stamina for longer climbs"

Good luck getting even a room to yourself for $1,000. It’s possible, it just might not be ideal. 

There is designated graduate housing, and they were supposedly assigning more with the new construction they did. If you sign up for a 12 mo program you get priority over those who sign up for 10 mo programs, and there is a waitlist.

Make sure you start looking EARLY. Like, March -May and definitely throughout June, when people are moving out from Winter and Spring quarters. 

Most places do credit checks and background checks and don’t allow pets and are priced ~$1,300 - $1,800 for single rooms in three+ bedroom houses. 

Single apartments are ~$2,600 not including utilities. There is the odd studio about 30min (1.5h with traffic) away in Watsonville for ~$1,200… but if I were you, I’d want to live close and bike around town/ to and from campus. 

Parking is even more of a hassle, but there are off campus lots on the bus line you can find, or, park in some of the far off neighborhoods near a bus line and make the commute. 

Best of luck!

kgy4akh,191h2b0,2024-01-08 12:34:23,"I've taken some of these classes. I wouldn't say they are ""hard"" but they are a lot of work. Sometimes unnecessarily so."

kgzygxe,191h2b0,2024-01-08 19:07:28,"I think that some of the engineering majors are the hardest in terms of workload, though physics may have a greater conceptual difficulty.

Robotics engineering probably has the highest workload, and biomolecular engineering (bioinformatics concentration) probably has the broadest range of topics.

I don't know what the easiest major on campus is, but pyschology is the most often chosen fall-back major."
kgy0zs6,191h2b0,2024-01-08 12:16:14,"As someone who did both Robotics and Cognitive Science---
I think robotics is probably the most difficult. I could see how something like applied math or BME could be up there as well.

The difficulty is pretty high, requirements are big, and a lot of the classes have extremely large projects/labs that you ""shouldn't take any other hard classes with"". They were really cool if you're interested in that type of puzzle engineering.

Cognitive science was incredibly interesting, however almost intuitive for a lot of reasons. The classes never required much work outside of the class if you paid attention. Probably total outside of class time, took about 1/5th to 1/10th the time of the outside class time I put in on average for robotics classes.

I'm not saying cognitive science was the easiest, but damn it was a different world."

kgy8552,191h2b0,2024-01-08 12:55:17,"It depends on the specialization I would say cause majors themselves can have concentrations or pathways. 

As an example, Computer Engineering used to have a concentration called Robotics and Control. It has been removed from CE major and changed into the newly made Robotics Engineering major. So a lot of the material for those in CE:R&C will overlap with those in RE. 

In my opinion it’s probably going to be biomedical engineering. That’s because I imagine that the level of precision that is needed is at a level that is at least on par with something like aerospace engineering."

kgp9cvu,190ak0u,2024-01-06 23:00:18,"When I was in the dorms I bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/Pomya-Adapter-RTL8812AU-Wireless-Network/dp/B07YB4ZJH8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2H6E7ZVUUEM2I&keywords=MT7612&qid=1704610374&sprefix=mt7612%2Caps%2C319&sr=8-3) adapter and it worked great. It works because it's a Mediatek chip and not a Realtek chip that causes problems on reswifi. The reviews are low because it was advertised as Realtek before but now it's mediatek which is exactly what we want in our case. If I could do it again I would try [this](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Archer-TX21UH-Wireless-Supports/dp/B0BZJRXT7X/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1077NTX1LJYSA&keywords=wifi%2B6%2Badapter&qid=1704610522&sprefix=wifi%2B6%2B%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-3&th=1) one as it's newer, faster, and has manufacture support but I am unsure if it will work or not but it could work.   


For a quick and dirty fix that's free you can follow the guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ymdxmq/blue_screen_fix_for_those_with_realtek_usb_wifi/) and it should work for some time but I've done this and noticed that occasionally windows will update and break the patch and it will go back to doing the blue screen even when it's being marked as a whitelisted driver to not auto update so I would just try the adapters I linked above."

kgagi92,18yelyn,2024-01-04 07:41:48,"Yeah, I visited elfland many times. It was a place where people would go hang out and get stoned. People built little of houses and brought in troll dolls and stuff and made little dioramas In the hollows underneath the trees.  And with no disrespect to the trees, they are about the same as the ones that still exist just behind College 910 now. Second growth redwoods. Big but not huge first growth stuff.

I work there at the time they were taken down. Students chained themselves to the bulldozers and the trees. There was one coed who stuck in my memory because she was being really dramatic about her protest while chained to the tree. Then a few weeks later, students protest at Hahn student services; Demanding that the university make itself more accessible to underrepresented students and POC. She was there at that one too, chanting and protesting. They had formed a human chain around the building and were denying people access. I needed to get in for a meeting. I walked up to her and said I recognized her from the tree protest. I pointed out that it was a bit ironic to be protesting against growth at the first of the month and then protesting tthe campus wasn’t growing fast enough to make itself accessible two weeks later. I told her the meeting I was trying to attend was about attracting more to represent students. She broke ranks and let me in the building.

So yeah, Elfland was a fun part of UCSC history and a great moment in time. But it’s demise allowed for the building of two new colleges that have given the opportunity for education to thousands and thousands of new students."

kh060lv,18yelyn,2024-01-08 19:55:49,I think the best bet would be if a current student could just go find it. Back then I was told special collection items can only be viewed in the special collections reading room. I imagine it’s still the same policy.

kgd0qho,18yelyn,2024-01-04 16:33:18,can someone line this up with where 9/10 are on a map
kgoo3db,18yelyn,2024-01-06 19:56:38,"If you look closely at the map - it has ""College None"" written along the right margin, and a line pointing to the bottom of the page. The map isn't at all to scale, but the topmost parts of Colleges 9/10 are just below Elfland.

This map was drawn by my friend Steve in the summer of 1990 so he could give it to another friend named Julie.  Julie has since lost the original, but before he gave it to Julie Steve, made me this photocopy (because I thought it was cool)."

kgjsqip,18zpt3l,2024-01-05 21:52:41,"I'm sure we'll find out the reason in due time, no need to protest for something we're gonna get eventually, it would do more harm than good"
kgjjobd,18zpt3l,2024-01-05 20:35:05,"Definitely more can be done if someone goes and talks to people responsible for the investigation, for starters. Or writes an open letter, or calls etc. Any of this is more productive than protesting. What are you going to protest, specifically? Campus already took old loop buses out of circulation.

Edit: also, you are welcome to organize whatever you want and not wait for the others to do something."

OP, you need to stop asking for her full name, she’s not a public employee and you’re not entitled to that. It’s basically real life doxxing, regardless of whether or not you think you were treated fairly.

If you’ve got a problem with how you were treated, report it to their supervisor, corporate Safeway, etc etc. Complain about it on social media, and don’t shop there in the future. Stop trying to dig up and expose private information about a private employee. This post should be taken down TBH."

kgcaped,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 13:56:49,that is the biggest stretch i've seen all day
kg90qd8,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 23:32:12,It's likely criminal assault because the security guard does not have PC to invoke shopkeepers’ privilege.
kgccuzz,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 14:09:00,"""PC"" is literally irrelevant if we're not talking about a police officer"
kgp45i6,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 22:07:35,So any private establishment can at any time search you and all of your belongings with 0 concern for privacy? And can take any of your belongings from you for whatever reason they claim? Don't speak with authority while being ignorant yourself.
kgpklp3,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 01:10:52,"Of course not. None of that is relevant to my comment, so I'm not sure why you said it."
kgxt2yj,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 11:32:44,"Probable cause is a legal term independent of police officers and is very relevant to this incident. You were wrong and I let you know that, how is that not relevant to your comment?"
kgzg58a,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 17:14:58,"I didn't imply any of the silly hypotheticals you attributed to me. Obviously another private citizen can't lawfully search me or seize my possessions without my consent.

Also, you're wrong about ""probable cause"" applying to private security guards. If you can find a source backing you up I'll edit all of my comments and give you credit."
kgcx8pz,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 16:11:33,"For constitutional violations, you are correct. But you can only invoke shopkeeper’s privilege, to negate false imprisonment or even battery, if you have PC of stealing."
kgzb4p6,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 16:44:21,"Security guards do need probable cause to search belongings if they believe you have stolen something from the business they are hired to protect, but that could be as simple as someone walking around suspiciously. They don't need to have seen you physically take items to request a bag search"
kgzguv2,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 17:19:17,"If you can find a source indicating that security guards have any authority whatsoever to search you, or that probable cause is relevant to security guards in any capacity, I'll edit all my comments and credit you."
kgdk16s,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:36:32,"No, it's not. Story doesn't even make sense. OP has no right to her information ."
kgdgct2,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:12:19,Of course a security guard hired by the store can rely on shopkeepers privilege.
kgdgjlv,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:13:35,But only if there is probable cause they committed Penal Code 459.5 shoplifting.
kgexxas,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 02:26:44,if she had her steps then it’s fine.
kgexttm,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 02:25:35,if they are contracted by the store; yeah they can
kgtb5un,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 16:19:35,That's physical asault at best.
kguzvzm,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 22:46:18,"What is it at worst? She shouldn’t have grabbed their bag, but seems pretty benign on the spectrum of physical assault."
khtlntw,18y3vbz,2024-01-14 07:11:45,At worst  it's battery
kgzakjg,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 16:40:56,"I would be skeptical of OPs use of the term ""yank"". A security guard has the right to search your belongings if you are in a store and they have probably cause to believe you have stolen something. 

The fact that OP is trying to start an internet manhunt instead of contacting the store managers or the security guard company makes me doubt their story"
kg92i8f,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 23:53:16,She committed battery. And refused to give us any information to report her to a higher up
kg96zdj,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 00:47:54,would you?
kgeqdvz,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 00:53:36,You have the security company’s name right there.
kgkbk9h,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 01:28:13,"Please contact the authorities, the store should have security footage at the checkout area… I’m more than a little concerned that you could also be this poor security guard’s stalker"
kgdwf56,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 20:02:29,File a police report or shut up.
kgq0b5v,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 04:19:33,Thank you for this comment
kgh7fb9,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 11:43:53,"Why didn’t you call the cops then? That’s the proper response to assault, not doxxing."

kgdaq7c,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 17:36:03,This is social media and she is complaining about it here.

kglmrst,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 08:34:26,So what you are saying is that it’s ok for some security guard to rough up someone with no reason and get away with it?
kgmtyjf,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:53:15,How did she rough them up exactly? And based on one persons description who obviously is very emotional is your only source
kgnxssy,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 17:00:22,Is this you? Or is she your family member or are you a rent a cop with the same entitlement? Op DO NOT TAKE THIS DOWN and thank you for the heads up.

kg8por2,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 21:37:05,They are either contracted through Safeway or they actually work for Safeway’s Loss Prevention. But just googling turned up that Garda World is a private security company based out of San Jose. So either complain to Safeway Corporate or contact the security company.
kg8o0e5,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 21:22:08,"You are conflating a police officer with private security. No badge number (or requirement to tell their name). They don't have to have probable cause, and they also don't have any right to search you even if they did. You can choose to walk out, just like they can choose not to sell anything to you.

kgac2uh,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 07:14:07,"Grabbing stuff from your hand is battery, falsely accusing someone of a crime in California is also a crime.  Loss prevention needs to witness you taking from the store and leaving the store in order to physically pursue you.  They also need video evidence.  


OP this is a landslide civil case for you. If I was you I would continue to be diligent. Contact Safeway management and try to get her name, file a police report, then go forward with the motions of speaking to an attorney about your options.   


There are cameras all over that store, so it will be 100% impossible for them to win this case unless you are lying about stealing, in which case, you should take this post down and slap yourself in the face for being so stupid."

kgkyo47,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:44:22,I think you’re missing the point which is security has to be 100% sure  they do steal in order to approach them. Security isnt allowed to touch you or your belongings.
kgkz49z,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:48:12,They can't and OP already reported them so I don't see what else there is to do. There's no way to tell the truth though if the security decided to just lie and say they thought they were 100% sure OP stole. If OP legitimately feels like it was criminal assault they should have contacted the police and not try to get some internet mob to attack someone based off of one sides interpretation

kgmh50t,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 11:35:49,"Correct, it is a source of direct evidence after all. Criminal cases are decided on the principle of innocence until proven guilty, so theoretically if an eyewitness testimony of the victim is the only evidence offered by either parties, then that would be enough to reach a verdict. Although clearly in practice, the opposition could just as easily offer their own account or offer more compelling evidence via multiple witnesses, audio/visual recordings, exhibits, etc. Hence why personal testimony isn’t particularly strong since it’s your word against theirs."
kgmub8t,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:55:24,It’s actually not. You think it’s normal procedure for prosecutors to go forward with a case based on one person’s testimony? Because that is quite famously not the case

She was calm the entire time, even when you were in her face, yelling and cursing at her. She didn't ""yank"" anything from you, she asked for your bag and took a peak. She even gave you her name, and she stood there so you could take that picture. You are in the wrong. It's disgusting that you are posting this on here. I've seen so many students try to walk out with Safeway stuff, including alcohol. I look forward to coming to this store and having small conversations with her.

They’re not supposed to lay their hands on someone without talking to them first or telling them the cause. having someone grab you from behind out of the blue and start searching your bag aggressively without saying anything is not doing their job correctly. I agree with security searching customers with cause. but grabbing someone out of the blue and searching their shit without telling us and then screaming that we’re stealing ain’t it. When we asked for her name and badge when she found out we didn’t take shit she began denying shit and running away.

kg8wnou,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 22:46:03,The only thing she did wrong was unprofessionally told you not to steal and grabbing your personal item without your permission. Maybe she had probable cause  for her actions. There always a two sides of the story.

2 potential battery

3 if she went through your stuff before you bought it, its probably fine legally, since it's safeway's stuff. If it was after check out, it could be legally dicy because thats your stuff. Shops can't legally check your stuff without your consent, even tho there might be a person at the door checking, unless its a membership place like costco you can just walk past. Ofc receipt checkers aren't lawyers so don't be surprised if they make a scene over it.

4 you won't do anything legally unless you want to spend a lot of money, so just report it to safeway"

kgbqra8,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 12:05:16,"What a Karenish post, she's doing her job. You already reported her for allegedly making a scene that who knows without the footage could've looked like theft. What happened to ucsc? No chill anymore. Be glad it's not a Blackwater guard."
kg96rv2,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 00:45:20,I mean why did you let her do that to you?  They ain't cops.  And she looks soft.  Why you put up with that.
kghbd2a,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 12:05:56,"Some of these comments are a bit drastic… it’s definitely worth being mad if someone put their hands on you or your belongings without consent, especially to look inside personal property with no cause. If it were me I’d be doing the same"
kgig3m7,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 16:05:00,Actually in most instances they can search you based on a “reasonable suspicion” alone

khnjixi,18y3vbz,2024-01-13 03:03:32,"This store has a CONSISTANT stream of theives. Entitled students and hobos who think it's okay to steal cause it's ""just food'"". It's food, liquor, laundry soap etc REGULARLY walking out the doors. My grocery prices are high to cover the costs of Safeway's loss. Can't wait till they close this store, like they have done all across the US. They are a business. If their loss out weighs there profits  ... they will tap out. Just like they have done in Oakland and San Francisco. If you're not stealing then there is nothing to be offered by."

OP, you need to stop asking for her full name, she’s not a public employee and you’re not entitled to that. It’s basically real life doxxing, regardless of whether or not you think you were treated fairly.

If you’ve got a problem with how you were treated, report it to their supervisor, corporate Safeway, etc etc. Complain about it on social media, and don’t shop there in the future. Stop trying to dig up and expose private information about a private employee. This post should be taken down TBH."

kgcaped,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 13:56:49,that is the biggest stretch i've seen all day
kg90qd8,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 23:32:12,It's likely criminal assault because the security guard does not have PC to invoke shopkeepers’ privilege.
kgccuzz,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 14:09:00,"""PC"" is literally irrelevant if we're not talking about a police officer"
kgp45i6,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 22:07:35,So any private establishment can at any time search you and all of your belongings with 0 concern for privacy? And can take any of your belongings from you for whatever reason they claim? Don't speak with authority while being ignorant yourself.
kgpklp3,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 01:10:52,"Of course not. None of that is relevant to my comment, so I'm not sure why you said it."
kgxt2yj,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 11:32:44,"Probable cause is a legal term independent of police officers and is very relevant to this incident. You were wrong and I let you know that, how is that not relevant to your comment?"
kgzg58a,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 17:14:58,"I didn't imply any of the silly hypotheticals you attributed to me. Obviously another private citizen can't lawfully search me or seize my possessions without my consent.

Also, you're wrong about ""probable cause"" applying to private security guards. If you can find a source backing you up I'll edit all of my comments and give you credit."
kgcx8pz,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 16:11:33,"For constitutional violations, you are correct. But you can only invoke shopkeeper’s privilege, to negate false imprisonment or even battery, if you have PC of stealing."
kgzb4p6,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 16:44:21,"Security guards do need probable cause to search belongings if they believe you have stolen something from the business they are hired to protect, but that could be as simple as someone walking around suspiciously. They don't need to have seen you physically take items to request a bag search"
kgzguv2,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 17:19:17,"If you can find a source indicating that security guards have any authority whatsoever to search you, or that probable cause is relevant to security guards in any capacity, I'll edit all my comments and credit you."

kgdgct2,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:12:19,Of course a security guard hired by the store can rely on shopkeepers privilege.
kgdgjlv,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:13:35,But only if there is probable cause they committed Penal Code 459.5 shoplifting.
kgexxas,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 02:26:44,if she had her steps then it’s fine.
kgexttm,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 02:25:35,if they are contracted by the store; yeah they can
kgtb5un,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 16:19:35,That's physical asault at best.
kguzvzm,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 22:46:18,"What is it at worst? She shouldn’t have grabbed their bag, but seems pretty benign on the spectrum of physical assault."
khtlntw,18y3vbz,2024-01-14 07:11:45,At worst  it's battery
kgzakjg,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 16:40:56,"I would be skeptical of OPs use of the term ""yank"". A security guard has the right to search your belongings if you are in a store and they have probably cause to believe you have stolen something. 

The fact that OP is trying to start an internet manhunt instead of contacting the store managers or the security guard company makes me doubt their story"
kg92i8f,18y3vbz,2024-01-03 23:53:16,She committed battery. And refused to give us any information to report her to a higher up
kg96zdj,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 00:47:54,would you?
kgeqdvz,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 00:53:36,You have the security company’s name right there.

kgkyo47,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:44:22,I think you’re missing the point which is security has to be 100% sure  they do steal in order to approach them. Security isnt allowed to touch you or your belongings.
kgkz49z,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:48:12,They can't and OP already reported them so I don't see what else there is to do. There's no way to tell the truth though if the security decided to just lie and say they thought they were 100% sure OP stole. If OP legitimately feels like it was criminal assault they should have contacted the police and not try to get some internet mob to attack someone based off of one sides interpretation
kgkze6m,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:50:29,"I don't know if you're having trouble reading or what, but my post clearly says that the OP should file a police report then speak to a lawyer about his options.

kgmh50t,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 11:35:49,"Correct, it is a source of direct evidence after all. Criminal cases are decided on the principle of innocence until proven guilty, so theoretically if an eyewitness testimony of the victim is the only evidence offered by either parties, then that would be enough to reach a verdict. Although clearly in practice, the opposition could just as easily offer their own account or offer more compelling evidence via multiple witnesses, audio/visual recordings, exhibits, etc. Hence why personal testimony isn’t particularly strong since it’s your word against theirs."
kgmub8t,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:55:24,It’s actually not. You think it’s normal procedure for prosecutors to go forward with a case based on one person’s testimony? Because that is quite famously not the case

kgkyo47,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:44:22,I think you’re missing the point which is security has to be 100% sure  they do steal in order to approach them. Security isnt allowed to touch you or your belongings.
kgkz49z,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:48:12,They can't and OP already reported them so I don't see what else there is to do. There's no way to tell the truth though if the security decided to just lie and say they thought they were 100% sure OP stole. If OP legitimately feels like it was criminal assault they should have contacted the police and not try to get some internet mob to attack someone based off of one sides interpretation
kgkze6m,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:50:29,"I don't know if you're having trouble reading or what, but my post clearly says that the OP should file a police report then speak to a lawyer about his options.

Criminal cases are decided on the principle of innocence until proven guilty, so theoretically if an eyewitness testimony of the victim is the only evidence offered by either parties, then that would be enough to reach a verdict. Although clearly in practice, the opposition could just as easily offer their own account or offer more compelling evidence via multiple witnesses, audio/visual recordings, exhibits, etc. Hence why personal testimony isn’t particularly strong since it’s your word against theirs."
kgmub8t,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:55:24,It’s actually not. You think it’s normal procedure for prosecutors to go forward with a case based on one person’s testimony? Because that is quite famously not the case
kgn1qnv,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 13:40:35,"….yes, it quite famously is the case? Basically all sexual assault and domestic violence cases are based on a single witness. I was a juror in a criminal assault case where the only witnesses were the defendant and the alleged victim."

kg96zdj,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 00:47:54,would you?
kgeqdvz,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 00:53:36,You have the security company’s name right there.
kgkbk9h,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 01:28:13,"Please contact the authorities, the store should have security footage at the checkout area… I’m more than a little concerned that you could also be this poor security guard’s stalker"
kgdwf56,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 20:02:29,File a police report or shut up.
kgq0b5v,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 04:19:33,Thank you for this comment
kgh7fb9,18y3vbz,2024-01-05 11:43:53,"Why didn’t you call the cops then? That’s the proper response to assault, not doxxing."
kgmtsft,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:52:13,You’re such a child
kgzbhc6,18y3vbz,2024-01-08 16:46:32,"Call the security company instead of asking reddit, you moron."
kgv04ui,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 22:48:36,Doxxing someone to try and ruin their life isn’t a proportionate response to them grabbing your bag  to check for stolen items in a moment of poor judgement.
kgmtyjf,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 12:53:15,How did she rough them up exactly? And based on one persons description who obviously is very emotional is your only source
kgd2bfy,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 16:43:10,"Police won’t do shit, you need to do all of their work for them and then pray that they will actually take you seriously"
kgdmpgr,18y3vbz,2024-01-04 18:54:10,I’m sorry if that has been your experience. It was not mine.
kgmki8p,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 11:55:55,It is everyone’s experience what
kgosy08,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 20:32:27,They just said that it wasn’t their experience so obviously it’s not everyone’s. Do you know the meaning of *everyone*?
kgsc6tc,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 13:10:50,So the alternative is to go on the internet and dox someone? If the cops won’t do shit guess what? It may not have been that severe of a crime. Get a lawyer. You know where to serve her the paperwork if you want to take this to civil court.

kgt6aby,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 15:53:28,Lol people get touched and think it’s battery. This whole thing is a waste of time. OP should just move on  with his life lol
kgt6kc0,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 15:54:59,That’s the literal definition of criminal battery. Forcefully touching someone or their belongings.
kgtd6k1,18y3vbz,2024-01-07 16:30:43,Based on what op described it’s not worth the hassle and money battling though court systems. He’s be better off scoring a higher paying job than waste time trying to win this case for a few grand.

kgkz49z,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:48:12,They can't and OP already reported them so I don't see what else there is to do. There's no way to tell the truth though if the security decided to just lie and say they thought they were 100% sure OP stole. If OP legitimately feels like it was criminal assault they should have contacted the police and not try to get some internet mob to attack someone based off of one sides interpretation
kgkze6m,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 05:50:29,"I don't know if you're having trouble reading or what, but my post clearly says that the OP should file a police report then speak to a lawyer about his options.   


If the lawyer tells him he doesn't have a case, then at the very least the incident is on file if they're ever retaliated against or assaulted again. Your advice that the OP should ""do nothing"" isn't really advice at all....js."

kgp45i6,18y3vbz,2024-01-06 22:07:35,So any private establishment can at any time search you and all of your belongings with 0 concern for privacy? And can take any of your belongings from you for whatever reason they claim? Don't speak with authority while being ignorant yourself.

kg8gkb5,18xx0m0,2024-01-03 20:21:13,"2023 was done by colleges, and it lasted much longer than just a few minutes. There are a few remarks by admin, a student address, and then each graduate walks. They had several photo stations, two after crossing before you meet up with the grad, then a photo op with your people. After, they have some DIY photo booths/opportunities all over OPERS, refreshments, and merch booths if you want grad specific merch. 

It wasn’t hours and hours with gobs of traffic and no parking, probably an hour and a half or so in total. It was actually a really nice ceremony."

Chemistry won’t be all that relevant, so I wouldn’t worry about that too much. The main thing you will need to start is a strong math (algebra, trig, and maybe some calculus) background and any physics learning will of course give you a head start."
kgdalv2,18yth9x,2024-01-04 17:35:19,"Thanks for responding, I’m taking precalc honors as a junior right now, and plan to take AP calculus AB senior year. Do you think not being in AB as a junior lowers my chance of getting in? and will i really struggle in this course without having taken calc BC or multi var calculus etc. 
I scored B’s in most of my math classes due to not caring as much about getting A’s as i should’ve  but math was never a topic i insanely struggled with."
kgdcnml,18yth9x,2024-01-04 17:48:19,"The first physics class you take (phys 5A) only relies on Calc AB as a prerequisite, so you should be completely fine. However if your AP physics class is calculus based (AP Physics C I think it’s called) then you can likely skip phys 5A. If this is the case then you would need to take another calculus class (math 19B) in order to take phys 5B, 5C, etc. I’d recommend looking at this link since it shows all the classes you need to take and you can look at their prerequisites: https://catalog.ucsc.edu/current/general-catalog/academic-units/physical-and-biological-sciences-division/physics/physics-astrophysics-bs/"
kgdpaab,18yth9x,2024-01-04 19:11:49,"I like how both of these comments above are basically the two sides of my inner personality. But yes, I was astrophysics and both of these comments are correct. Your high school classes do not matter. All you should leave high school with is a prepared mental to be challenged and the time that will need to be spent to hone your problem solving skills. If you want to get started early, look into very very very basic computing skills in python as well as brush up on your calc and algebra skills."
kgin8w9,18yth9x,2024-01-05 16:50:03,"Hi OP my partner just graduated from UCSC with a BS in astro (and I am a chem grad getting my chem MS at another school now).

Your career options with an astrophysics BS (not purely physics) are almost zero. My partner has 3+ years of hands on research and has struggled to get into a PhD program. If you want to pursue astro you will need a PhD for most careers. The PhD applicants are very competitive and you need to have very good research and grades to easily get into a PhD program. If you fall in love with the courses then do the BS+MS 5 year program to get as much research as possible to help get a job/ continue in academia.

For chem (in case you were also considering a chem major) you can get a lot of work with a chem BS but, on *average*, it doesn't pay super well. Location matters and most work out of college will get 40-60K for your first 5 years of work or longer. 

My advice is for any STEM career is to get into a research lab as soon as possible. Itll help you with graduate school, getting jobs, and most importantly finding out what you hate/love to do for work.

Message me if you have any questions"
kgoamfw,18yth9x,2024-01-06 18:23:41,The degree is purely physics with just a concentration in astrophysics at ucsc. Also where is this person looking for jobs? I already have some offers lined up in case I don’t get into grad school and they all are paying in the 120k to 130k ballpark
kgoe0ac,18yth9x,2024-01-06 18:46:26,You have job offers in the area of astrophysics? What type of work have you been offered? California? Her research was on exoplanets which wasn't something she found job offers for at the BS level. I would say over 120-130k starting is impressive for any major so congratulations

kg92ey0,18y7obc,2024-01-03 23:52:12,For some classes it can be allowed at the discretion of the professor I believe
kg92iwn,18y7obc,2024-01-03 23:53:29,"Oh, good idea. I talked with my advisors and they said I have to take another year :( but I will def reach out."
kg98z00,18y7obc,2024-01-04 01:12:50,What course is it? Some courses have prerequisites that can kinda be skipped like ece 103 doesn’t need 101 all that much. But others yeah
kg9e2nh,18y7obc,2024-01-04 02:16:52,It's for 123A. Im missing the 121 prereq
kg9ec04,18y7obc,2024-01-04 02:20:04,"you probably can get around it, it helps to know a bit of iot and working on a microcontroller but most projects have different aspects that require different skills, go to class and ask harrison about it"
kg9ef2x,18y7obc,2024-01-04 02:21:04,I hope so. Thanks for the insight.
kg9dtvd,18y7obc,2024-01-04 02:13:53,"Yes. I am currently taking two courses that way. You need to reach out to the professor directly and give them the confidence that you'll do good in their class. If approved, they'll give you a permission code to bypass the enrollment prerequisite(s) and you'll be good to go for the quarter.

Try to not involve advising and the department as much as you can (but I am also a rather cynical person)."
kg9e0di,18y7obc,2024-01-04 02:16:05,"That gives me hope. I sent the email, and yeah, advising is not that helpful tbh. They kinda r the ones that got me in this situation in the first place..."

“Earlier today you received an email stating you would be getting a refund check from UCSC. Unfortunately due to a technical issue with the refund processing, checks were not able to be completed. Student Business Services is working to correct the issue so refunds can be reprocessed on Friday 01/05/24.

For students with direct deposit set up prior to Friday's refunding, refunds will be sent directly to your bank account and are usually received within 24-48 hours.

For students with no direct deposit set up, checks will be issued and mailed out to your address listed in MyUCSC and can take up to 7-10 days to receive.

To make sure you receive your refund quickly we encourage everyone to sign up for direct deposit and make sure your Mailing Address is up to date in MyUCSC.”"

From the few time I've visited Mattie during office hours, she's a little new to the university, but she gave good insights in terms of your game projects and really emphasizes + encourages you guys to talk about your work, prepping you to be able to exhibit your game works one day in the future - I think just as long as you're engaged with the class and complete your project, you'll do well in her class.

EOP (extended opportunity program basically for poor students) and STARS (transfer student center) is there to help students like us!!!!

Slug support/ basic needs/ free pantry’s

Unfortunately when you’re a senior the school couldn’t care less. They treat you like an incoming freshman and hype up all the packages you get when you first transfer, but when you come back next yr they barely consider you. The only benefits to being a senior is the parking passes. I applied to every housing spot i could and I did the application minutes after it came out and I still didnt get housing. And even though it’s technically only your 2nd year when it would be your senior year it doesnt matter with housing, non transfer students can get 2-3 yrs on campus and transfers mostly will just get their first year. I got offered a spot in a triple in the transfer building literally two weeks before school started this yr but thats the best you can get :/ I would try applying still, but your best bet is gonna be off campus."

kg263z2,18wxkri,2024-01-02 16:57:36,"Unfortunately the school is constantly blocked by lawsuits when they attempt to build new housing, it's not entirely their fault the situation is so bad here."
kg0uvxd,18wxkri,2024-01-02 12:13:47,"Kinda confused by the nature of your post - if you're not planning on working while going to school I assume you'll be taking out loans to cover tuition, in which case that's what you'll be using to pay for housing as well regardless of whether you're on-campus or off"
kg0vynd,18wxkri,2024-01-02 12:19:57,"Mmm well I do go to a CC so as of now, I don’t really know how 4-year uni housing works, so it’s a learning process for me. 
I plan to (hopefully) qualify for the UC’s blue & gold tuition cover. So in theory I would only hopefully have to cover housing. I think in my mind, being able to live on campus just seems way more convenient. I don’t really know how financial aid disbursements works, so a big fear of mine is “what if I’m renting a place with other people and I don’t get rent money on time?” Like that seems really messed up to have roommates bear the cost of my financial misfortunes. Where as in living on campus, I’m assuming you have some time to pay off what you owe? 
So yeah that’s my post: how hard would it be to live/get accepted into housing my senior year."
kg14aje,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:07:14,"I was also an older transfer too & got all my classes paid for & they gave me a refund each quarter that I used to pay for my off-campus place. It’s cheaper to live off-campus & I found my place on the Facebook housing group. I had a shared room for ~800 in downtown, down the street from the beach & it was probably the best apartment I’ve ever lived in full of windows & walking distance to downtown. I wasn’t able to secure a campus spot in the grove until after starting and I think they wanted to charge me almost 2x what I was paying, so not worth it at all for me. So I missed out on a more traditional campus dorm life, but I paid less and had a better overall time living off campus as an older student."
kg16ht3,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:19:52,Mmm good point. Yeah I also think of the downsides of possibly being out in an apartment/dorm with younger people. Not only cuz of the negative stigma I’d face of being older (they make 24 yr old feel like 50😭😂) but also just difference in life experience and maturity I guess. I’m definitely being convinced rn about off campus or finding my own place; I hope I also get lucky with financial aid assistance. Thank u for your input! <3
kg128b5,18wxkri,2024-01-02 12:55:32,"You’ll be fine, I’m graduating in June and have lived off campus my entire time as a transfer from a CC. I don’t have a job and have gotten FAFSA to cover most since my financial situation, then the rest was private loans. I’ll be graduating with 20k in debt total. If you have a qualifying degree you can also get automatic calfresh. For CS calfresh was instant. It’s not bad if you want to go to UCSC and you’re broke it’s doable like I did. There’s some options for housing off campus I’ve heard of from some friends that genuinely save them more money too and they get more independence and space. I have a friend paying $650 for a single room downtown… and I also know others who got lucky with a full 1 bedroom apartment for $1400. If you look at the right times (for me it was around graduation) you can find a lot of deals as well."
kg14nqo,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:09:22,"Ahh thank u! I also want to only be in about 20k (wish it could be 0 haha), but it feels good hearing about other success stories."
kg60gu6,18wxkri,2024-01-03 11:20:49,It’ll all work out as long as you are on top of your stuff! Good luck! UCSC is a really beautiful campus.
kg30qo0,18wxkri,2024-01-02 20:26:13,Everything you've read about housing is true. Banking on getting housing at UCSC is a huge mistake. I strongly suggest you save as much money as you can your first year so you can help to float your second. I would reconsider at least getting a part time campus job. Even breathing costs money out here.
kg59x4c,18wxkri,2024-01-03 08:47:25,"No exactly, that's been my experience as a transfer. First year was able to get OC housing (that year it wasn't even a guarantee) and then my senior year I got off campus housing, just sharing a room in a house with housemates. I would definitely recommend trying to live on campus your first year so that finding housing off campus is less stressful (a 4 hour drive away means its difficult to see places and arrange things -- most ppl begin housing search in march/april). Housing situation is sucky (share a house and kitchen with 8 people) but there isn't much you can do when you go to ucsc and live in a town where apt buildings take forever to be built and always seem to be luxury and the school is always getting sued for trying to build new housing."
kg5d55a,18wxkri,2024-01-03 09:07:46,"It can happen, but people who typically put all their eggs into one basket are the ones who end up homeless. Being proactive about finding a place is how you ensure you don't end up that way.  


The reality is there are less rooms than there are students. So someone is going to end up sleeping in their car, don't let it be you."
kg6of0k,18wxkri,2024-01-03 13:35:42,"Thank u, I think I was getting into that mentality of putting blind trust into the school of getting housing my last year.

kg1ox63,18wxkri,2024-01-02 15:08:42,"Just have to say. If you are going to be stressed out about money, Santa Cruz may not be the place for you. So. Expensive.
I would definitely look into other cheaper transfer options as you plan ahead. Many, many good options in state at other UCs and also CSU."
kg1xf10,18wxkri,2024-01-02 16:02:31,"Not necessarily about money, I’ve accepted the reality of having to take out a loan. Just more stressed about finding a place to live on campus, which was what my post was about. 
I also really like my major’s program at Santa Cruz, and I like the research aspect of UC’s along with the tight knit alumni community of UC’s. 
I do have 3 other CSU’s as back ups, as well as 2 Cal Poly’s. And maybe along the way I’ll change my mind about attending or even won’t get accepted, but I did want to reach out and scope of the current scene."
kg0mj98,18wxkri,2024-01-02 11:26:14,"shiii i cant say for sure but i THINK they try to prioritize grad students [and families?] so you’d probably be 3rd in line (i.e; not GREAT chances). you might try to make your case to somebody in housing — earlier the better. 

And that goes for in general too. there ARE cheap places (~$900/mo) to live, you just have to be super vigilant and communicative to secure them. look on craiglist, nextdoor, hell— this reddit page …months in advance. good luck"
kg0piep,18wxkri,2024-01-02 11:43:08,"They dont put families at redwood grove, just students over 23. Families go to family student housing"
kg0pxn5,18wxkri,2024-01-02 11:45:34,yeah i was hesitant to include families. although now that i think about it another potential demographic that might be prioritized handicapped students?  do u know?
kg11ed9,18wxkri,2024-01-02 12:50:50,Pretty sure that through the DRC disabled students can get priority housing but this applies for every kind of housing on campus. Not just for Redwood Grove
kg254ah,18wxkri,2024-01-02 16:51:12,"Just an FYI, Redwood is for new transfers only. That means that you cannot apply for a spot there except for the year you transfer (I know because I applied for all forms of on-campus housing as a senior last year). Also I was 24 when I was accepted as a transfer, pretty similar to you. If you file for FAFSA and make sure you're in-state and independent you'll get financial aid for sure. Can't say how much but you won't have to completely pay out of pocket in that case."
kg25wiq,18wxkri,2024-01-02 16:56:15,Woahhh thank u I didn’t know about it being only for new transfers!
kg2cepz,18wxkri,2024-01-02 17:37:49,housing is bad. me and all my freshman year friends all haven’t had housing since then. it’s rough out here. Living off campus has also been rough. a few times already i’ve had to wait 30+min for a second bus to get to my apartment because how crowded buses are with people using it to travel around campus and some off campus.
kg2zq9u,18wxkri,2024-01-02 20:18:17,"Damn that sucks, I’ve definitely read some horror stories. This thread is def giving me lots of things to think about and take into consideration if I get in. 
How’s your experience been like? Does this make you regret going to school there?"
kg3f8dh,18wxkri,2024-01-02 22:36:40,"i do regret it. seeing the state of the uc enrollment process i should taken cc and transferred to berkeley or la or somewhere with more stuff to do. the campus is pretty yeah, but the city itself is relatively empty and small in general. if i want to go do something besides shopping and some downtown foods then id either need to take a hour long bus to san jose which has way more stuff or id need a car which leads to the parking issue.

I just think the city is very lacking compared to its neighbors and the school lacks many actives you’d expect such as certain in person clubs like a gaming club which sure we have some in person meetings but i was expecting more of an lan party each week style type club rather than mostly discord events. It’s hard to meet new people who like the same stuff as you like this. Idk i think i just expected too much, i thought it’d be like any other city school"
kg3gd5u,18wxkri,2024-01-02 22:48:51,"don’t get me wrong btw, i think this school is still great but like it’s insane how much it’s lacking.

(also not a santa cruz issue but a uc issue: the uc’s are so money hungry. like a 1week long summer research study trip sounds nice but when looking into it you are basically paying for the entire trip yourself and only thing added is u get a research paper to write and a professor to plan the trip for you). it’d be cheaper to go there yourself and you can actually not have a paper to write, stay longer, and enjoy what you want)"
kg6n4v8,18wxkri,2024-01-03 13:28:22,"I see what you mean. I’m not really putting such high expectations into it, but if you like the SoCal/big city vibe, then the school doesn’t seem like a good fit. Thanks for your input, it’s given me a lot to reflect on! Hope you finish up soon 👍"
kg7mm3t,18wxkri,2024-01-03 17:01:45,yep. oh definitely bring a book or 2 to read so you aren’t just in ur dorm all day doing hw. u can go to the library and sit on a nice couch with a cup of coffee on a nice warm day reading

kg7ql0g,18wxkri,2024-01-03 17:26:51,orientation week is your best friend. this first week is where you’ll meet the most people (usually around your dorm). then rest of the first year was for me at least just hanging out with people form my college. your roommates will be your best friend for your rest of your time here at ucsc no joke. You can meet a few other people in class and clubs (especially classes like electives which you find interesting). Making friends is hard here in my opinion but you make a ton of “acquaintances”
kg2jwba,18wxkri,2024-01-02 18:26:37,"I would highly recommend finding off-campus housing if at all possible. University housing is pretty overpriced, even by already comedic Santa Cruz housing prices."

As for work, girl I am not smart 😭I have to do hella studying just to barely scrape by, I tried working and school at the same time and I failed two classes, only working the bare minimum, and I really need to finish school ASAP cuz my fafsa is gonna run out very soon 😭😂"

I felt so isolated and alone I started going to all the free events (for socialization and free food). 

I also suggest you go to the some workout classes and stick to the same routine/time to make friends with common interests!!"

Have you ever regretted going to school there?"

We’re transfers so don’t regret anything!!! Even if you’re really sad. Life is always about putting in the effort. Im a 5th yr bc I let myself fail, PLS DONT DO THAT. No matter how shy (socially) or stupid (academically) you are feeling, you are NOT, this will pass and you BELONG there."
kg182jq,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:28:47,"Ooo okay, I’ll def try to do it (if I get accepted). Yeah I hope I make one good friend at least, I’m definitely the type of person to isolate myself and let myself fail, when I get overwhelmed.

kg263z2,18wxkri,2024-01-02 16:57:36,"Unfortunately the school is constantly blocked by lawsuits when they attempt to build new housing, it's not entirely their fault the situation is so bad here."
kg14aje,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:07:14,"I was also an older transfer too & got all my classes paid for & they gave me a refund each quarter that I used to pay for my off-campus place. It’s cheaper to live off-campus & I found my place on the Facebook housing group. I had a shared room for ~800 in downtown, down the street from the beach & it was probably the best apartment I’ve ever lived in full of windows & walking distance to downtown. I wasn’t able to secure a campus spot in the grove until after starting and I think they wanted to charge me almost 2x what I was paying, so not worth it at all for me. So I missed out on a more traditional campus dorm life, but I paid less and had a better overall time living off campus as an older student."
kg16ht3,18wxkri,2024-01-02 13:19:52,Mmm good point. Yeah I also think of the downsides of possibly being out in an apartment/dorm with younger people. Not only cuz of the negative stigma I’d face of being older (they make 24 yr old feel like 50😭😂) but also just difference in life experience and maturity I guess. I’m definitely being convinced rn about off campus or finding my own place; I hope I also get lucky with financial aid assistance. Thank u for your input! <3
kg60gu6,18wxkri,2024-01-03 11:20:49,It’ll all work out as long as you are on top of your stuff! Good luck! UCSC is a really beautiful campus.
kg5d55a,18wxkri,2024-01-03 09:07:46,"It can happen, but people who typically put all their eggs into one basket are the ones who end up homeless. Being proactive about finding a place is how you ensure you don't end up that way.  


The reality is there are less rooms than there are students. So someone is going to end up sleeping in their car, don't let it be you."

kg0pxn5,18wxkri,2024-01-02 11:45:34,yeah i was hesitant to include families. although now that i think about it another potential demographic that might be prioritized handicapped students?  do u know?
kg11ed9,18wxkri,2024-01-02 12:50:50,Pretty sure that through the DRC disabled students can get priority housing but this applies for every kind of housing on campus. Not just for Redwood Grove
kg3f8dh,18wxkri,2024-01-02 22:36:40,"i do regret it. seeing the state of the uc enrollment process i should taken cc and transferred to berkeley or la or somewhere with more stuff to do. the campus is pretty yeah, but the city itself is relatively empty and small in general. if i want to go do something besides shopping and some downtown foods then id either need to take a hour long bus to san jose which has way more stuff or id need a car which leads to the parking issue.

I just think the city is very lacking compared to its neighbors and the school lacks many actives you’d expect such as certain in person clubs like a gaming club which sure we have some in person meetings but i was expecting more of an lan party each week style type club rather than mostly discord events. It’s hard to meet new people who like the same stuff as you like this. Idk i think i just expected too much, i thought it’d be like any other city school"
kg3gd5u,18wxkri,2024-01-02 22:48:51,"don’t get me wrong btw, i think this school is still great but like it’s insane how much it’s lacking.

(also not a santa cruz issue but a uc issue: the uc’s are so money hungry. like a 1week long summer research study trip sounds nice but when looking into it you are basically paying for the entire trip yourself and only thing added is u get a research paper to write and a professor to plan the trip for you). it’d be cheaper to go there yourself and you can actually not have a paper to write, stay longer, and enjoy what you want)"
kg6n4v8,18wxkri,2024-01-03 13:28:22,"I see what you mean. I’m not really putting such high expectations into it, but if you like the SoCal/big city vibe, then the school doesn’t seem like a good fit. Thanks for your input, it’s given me a lot to reflect on! Hope you finish up soon 👍"
kg7mm3t,18wxkri,2024-01-03 17:01:45,yep. oh definitely bring a book or 2 to read so you aren’t just in ur dorm all day doing hw. u can go to the library and sit on a nice couch with a cup of coffee on a nice warm day reading

You can meet a few other people in class and clubs (especially classes like electives which you find interesting). Making friends is hard here in my opinion but you make a ton of “acquaintances”

As a staff member who has ridden them (and ridden many forms of public transit since 2007 when I gave up car ownership), they are the most unstable, unsafe vehicles I've ever experienced. I can't believe they have students packed like sardines and standing up on those things."

kg8jr7z,18x77bk,2024-01-03 20:46:25,"It’s pretty chill but the walls are as thin as they say so if you have loud neighbors and aren’t an easy sleeper earplugs will be nice I’m glad I brought those. You have a sink, fridge, and microwave but the stove is in a separate building. Same with laundry. People say it’s cold but you have central heating so it’s fine. People also noted the random insects and that’s true but it’s not that bad. Also if you’re here you’re going to be more reliant on the bus or your bicycle so plan accordingly. I have an ebike and I’m doing just fine. Would have preferred a place closer but it ain’t bad for the price."
kg5v262,18x77bk,2024-01-03 10:50:23,the village is calm with a bus stop close by. i think they’re cheaper than college dorms. each cabin has their own sink and fridge with private bathrooms. the only con for me is that it’s away from the main campus. bus schedules can be somewhat unpredictable when planning to take the bus to class. can be annoying at first but you’ll get used to it
kgecj4p,18x77bk,2024-01-04 22:17:31,"Pros: The cost for a single in the village my sophomore year was cheaper than what I was paying for a triple in college nine my freshman year so yes I would say the price is worth it. I liked the quietness and how secluded it was from main campus. The lounge room has a TV and vending machines. Sinks, fridge, freezer in every quad. 

Cons: The walk to get out is so annoying. No sunlight really gets in there because it’s basically in a ditch. No stoves in the quads so if your quad isn’t close to the village kitchen then it’s a little bit of a walk. ~14 people per quad. With so many people the fridge and freezer can get cluttered if your roommates are messy. Walls are thin. My single was at the end of the hall and I could hear people talking from the kitchen and rooms that were down the other end of the hall. Heating did not work in my building (C1) and they never fixed it throughout the entire year. We were freezing."

If you pick a topic that you know very little about then it will be a struggle but enjoyable, researching something you find interesting. On the other hand, if you pick an easy topic then it's a breeze, but can be boring. The course has little homework and primarily focuses on collecting 10-20 references for your topic and slowly developing your paper in LaTex. I wouldn't recommend it along Phys 112 and 110b as those require a lot of mental fortitude, unless you have a strong understanding of 110a. I'll be taking 110b as well this quarter, and I'm dreading it. Phys 112 on the other hand is 'easy' until it gets into the statical mechanics portion towards the end. 

An easy 2 credit class is TIMS 170, weekly talks from various speakers in tech and you write two small papers. CRSN 151-C was also an easy 3 credits that let you choose what to work on from CAD, PCB design, and other options. It's hard to recommend without knowing your interest/career aspirations."

kfr0zk6,18vekry,2023-12-31 13:17:50,R.i.p :(
kfr7348,18vekry,2023-12-31 13:57:01,"This situation is baffling because, based on what I gathered online, the tragedy occurred due to the school's inability to find parts for bus repairs. It seems absurd to me that a wealthy school can't invest in slightly newer buses, especially when new ones cost around $300,000 each. Spending a million dollars to acquire 3 or 4 new buses seems like a reasonable solution, considering the scale of their budget. It's disheartening that a family has to face this tragedy during Christmas, and it could have been avoided by investing in overdue bus replacements."
kfr7m0r,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:00:31,"There is only speculation surrounding what caused the collision. To assert that it was or wasn't a mechanical failure with present information is still premature. However, the recent incident of a bus catching fire raised suspicions about the condition of the buses (they are old), and these suspicions were carried to this incident. I would not be surprised to find that this was due to a mechanical failure, but that has not yet been determined."
kfr9c2d,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:11:53,"I get your point about the lack of clear evidence on mechanical failure. It's just, when I dug into it, everyone was talking about how awful the buses' condition is. There's this news article where the admin admits it's a struggle to find parts because the buses are so old, some even say they're way past their life span. It ticks me off that students, including myself, invest so much in education, yet we can't count on a reliable means of transportation. It hits close to home, selfish as it might sound, because it could've been me or my brothers in that situation, and that just doesn't sit right with me."
kfrevyx,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:49:12,"Only a few weeks before we had another bus on catch on fire with students on board as well if I am not mistaken. 
That being said, we had multiple students on board and I did talk to classmates who were in contact. I would think if the brakes failed there would have been a few seconds where the driver could have yelled to warn the students etc. word would have gone up the grapevine. Also I would think a bus driver would be trained to drive up the grassy hill next to the giant brick wall in the case of brake failure. Instead I have heard the opposite that points to the driver being unconscious at time of impact due to medical emergency. (Disclaimer I am not saying that is what happened, I am saying that is what I heard, I did not launch an investigation I just talked to some classmates.) I’m not trying to tarnish Dans name and have the deepest condolences for his family in this time and suggest everyone stops speculating and practices patience. 
All that being said regardless of this being a mechanical failure or a medical emergency it is a tragedy and it would be disrespectful to Dan Stevensons legacy not to in some way improve our transportation safety around campus in his wake."
kfrcpq6,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:34:29,Are these people commenting on the condition inside of the bus or are these mechanics who have looked at the buses in detail? Seems like the first one to me.

kfs0neb,18vekry,2023-12-31 17:23:41,"The first makes no claims, ""UC Santa Cruz Police is still investigating the cause of the crash.""

The second mostly reports the facts about the accident. It includes a student's opinion about the busses (in the third article).

The third is an opinion piece: ""in my opinion, seriously unsafe."" What credibility does ""Sebastián Valdez, a third-year psychology major"" have regarding bus maintenance?

Edit: in fact, the second article contradicts what you claim that ""There's this news article where the admin admits it's a struggle to find parts because the buses are so old, some even say they're way past their life span."" A transit driver explicitly says:

""A UCSC transit employee who declined to give their name told Lookout that they didn’t have safety concerns about the buses. “I haven’t really had any safety concerns that could cause possible accidents,” they said. “They’re old buses, but maintenance has been able to keep them up.”"
kftwlhp,18vekry,2024-01-01 05:32:40,"Valdez has credibility now: he wrote the article a month before the crash, and was proved right.

Next article: UC investigates UC bus crash. Sounds to me like the fox guarding the hen house.

Best way to honor Mr. Stevenson: upgrade the buses so you don't kill any more drivers or students. Rather than spin or lip service. 

This calls for an outside investigation. And a wrongful death lawsuit.

UCSC going to have to come up with several million dollars now, to settle the lawsuit. Guess the gamble didn't pay off. Penny wise and pound foolish. I wonder if they self-insure.

Perhaps the run down buses are a kind of performative poor mouthing."
kfuumbh,18vekry,2024-01-01 09:42:21,"Valdez still has no credibility. He's a third year psychology student. He's not a mechanic. He's not a liability expert. He hasn't investigated the accident. He hasn't even interviewed others that know. It's his opinion.

You have no idea about the case so claiming UCSC is going to owe a million dollars is just naive. Maybe they will, but maybe they won't owe a penny. I've not seen any details to make a judgement and you haven't presented any either."
kfy47f8,18vekry,2024-01-01 22:48:05,"in the article it says he works with the union on campus and that he got all his information from them and actual bus drivers, i think that is pretty credible"
kfy7gwi,18vekry,2024-01-01 23:25:37,"You criticize Valdez for not having investigated the accident, but the point is he predicted the accident before it happened. How do you expect him to investigate an accident that hasn't happened yet?"
kfypvvm,18vekry,2024-01-02 03:19:54,The accident has happened. What are you talking about? I'm not talking about his credibility in the past but now. He's making unsubstantiated claims.

kfwxuvk,18vekry,2024-01-01 17:24:14,They've got 12 million in reserves and 30+ year old buses. Blood is on the admins hands. Disgusting.

kfwk2h7,18vekry,2024-01-01 15:55:37,"FYI an electric bus is probably closer to 1 million USD. Not 300k. We're talking about a metro bus, not a school bus."

To the conspiracy theorist, I highly suggest waiting for official investigatory reports before drawing conclusions. As a state/ university entity, is there not NTSB investigatory jurisdiction here? Until a report is conclusive there is no reason to speculate unless you are a troll

Our thoughts and prayers should be focused on the family and the other passengers affected by this tragic accident. Does anyone one know how we can support them?"
kfrax77,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:22:22,is this the first the school has said of it? i don’t remember getting an email when the bus crashed earlier this month but maybe i just missed it.

kfrmfqp,18vekry,2023-12-31 15:42:41,The fact that one bus caught fire and another crashed in the same quarter points to lack of maintance by the school. This is 100% their fault.

kfr7m0r,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:00:31,"There is only speculation surrounding what caused the collision. To assert that it was or wasn't a mechanical failure with present information is still premature. However, the recent incident of a bus catching fire raised suspicions about the condition of the buses (they are old), and these suspicions were carried to this incident. I would not be surprised to find that this was due to a mechanical failure, but that has not yet been determined."
kfr9c2d,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:11:53,"I get your point about the lack of clear evidence on mechanical failure. It's just, when I dug into it, everyone was talking about how awful the buses' condition is. There's this news article where the admin admits it's a struggle to find parts because the buses are so old, some even say they're way past their life span. It ticks me off that students, including myself, invest so much in education, yet we can't count on a reliable means of transportation. It hits close to home, selfish as it might sound, because it could've been me or my brothers in that situation, and that just doesn't sit right with me."
kfrevyx,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:49:12,"Only a few weeks before we had another bus on catch on fire with students on board as well if I am not mistaken. 
That being said, we had multiple students on board and I did talk to classmates who were in contact. I would think if the brakes failed there would have been a few seconds where the driver could have yelled to warn the students etc. word would have gone up the grapevine. Also I would think a bus driver would be trained to drive up the grassy hill next to the giant brick wall in the case of brake failure. Instead I have heard the opposite that points to the driver being unconscious at time of impact due to medical emergency. (Disclaimer I am not saying that is what happened, I am saying that is what I heard, I did not launch an investigation I just talked to some classmates.) I’m not trying to tarnish Dans name and have the deepest condolences for his family in this time and suggest everyone stops speculating and practices patience. 
All that being said regardless of this being a mechanical failure or a medical emergency it is a tragedy and it would be disrespectful to Dan Stevensons legacy not to in some way improve our transportation safety around campus in his wake."
kfrcpq6,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:34:29,Are these people commenting on the condition inside of the bus or are these mechanics who have looked at the buses in detail? Seems like the first one to me.

kfrevyx,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:49:12,"Only a few weeks before we had another bus on catch on fire with students on board as well if I am not mistaken. 
That being said, we had multiple students on board and I did talk to classmates who were in contact. I would think if the brakes failed there would have been a few seconds where the driver could have yelled to warn the students etc. word would have gone up the grapevine. Also I would think a bus driver would be trained to drive up the grassy hill next to the giant brick wall in the case of brake failure. Instead I have heard the opposite that points to the driver being unconscious at time of impact due to medical emergency. (Disclaimer I am not saying that is what happened, I am saying that is what I heard, I did not launch an investigation I just talked to some classmates.) I’m not trying to tarnish Dans name and have the deepest condolences for his family in this time and suggest everyone stops speculating and practices patience. 
All that being said regardless of this being a mechanical failure or a medical emergency it is a tragedy and it would be disrespectful to Dan Stevensons legacy not to in some way improve our transportation safety around campus in his wake."
kfrcpq6,18vekry,2023-12-31 14:34:29,Are these people commenting on the condition inside of the bus or are these mechanics who have looked at the buses in detail? Seems like the first one to me.
kfs0neb,18vekry,2023-12-31 17:23:41,"The first makes no claims, ""UC Santa Cruz Police is still investigating the cause of the crash.""

The second mostly reports the facts about the accident. It includes a student's opinion about the busses (in the third article).

The third is an opinion piece: ""in my opinion, seriously unsafe."" What credibility does ""Sebastián Valdez, a third-year psychology major"" have regarding bus maintenance?

Edit: in fact, the second article contradicts what you claim that ""There's this news article where the admin admits it's a struggle to find parts because the buses are so old, some even say they're way past their life span."" A transit driver explicitly says:

""A UCSC transit employee who declined to give their name told Lookout that they didn’t have safety concerns about the buses. “I haven’t really had any safety concerns that could cause possible accidents,” they said. “They’re old buses, but maintenance has been able to keep them up.”"
kftwlhp,18vekry,2024-01-01 05:32:40,"Valdez has credibility now: he wrote the article a month before the crash, and was proved right.

Next article: UC investigates UC bus crash. Sounds to me like the fox guarding the hen house.

Best way to honor Mr. Stevenson: upgrade the buses so you don't kill any more drivers or students. Rather than spin or lip service. 

This calls for an outside investigation. And a wrongful death lawsuit.

UCSC going to have to come up with several million dollars now, to settle the lawsuit. Guess the gamble didn't pay off. Penny wise and pound foolish. I wonder if they self-insure.

Perhaps the run down buses are a kind of performative poor mouthing."

kfw4a73,18vr2th,2024-01-01 14:15:32,Peter is one of the best profs I had at ucsc. He’s such a weird and cool guy and had some really fresh perspectives on life that I really appreciated and still think about now that I’m in industry. I really admire him for leaving industry and returning to academia. He would often talk about how he commutes down from San Francisco area and stops and looks at the water and so on. His teaching style is a bit more loose and unconventional and stresses the more important points on things than focusing on the details.
kft2q2d,18vr2th,2023-12-31 23:15:25,"Veenstra is still teaching it but his class is full; Pusukuri is no longer at UCSC. 13S is getting curriculum changes, Alvaro's class will be doing the new curriculum and Veenstra's class will be updated with parts of the new curriculum. Veenstra's section will be harder and Alvaro's section will have ""a bigger focus on problem solving and debugging"" and clearer assignments.

13S is mainly a class on programming in C, and it also involves using a Linux terminal. I'd recommend that you know at least basic Linux commands and maybe some C too."
kfw9f4y,18vr2th,2024-01-01 14:47:11,"Had Alvaro for CSE 138. His lectures were pretty good and I learned a lot. However, he basically had the TA run the entirety of the assignments which quite frankly turned out horrible (assignment manual filled with typos / misinformation, vague requirements, little to no sample test cases). This was incredibly frustrating considering I poured hours into these assignments, optimizing my code and checking for edge cases, just to lose 50% of the grade because some crucial information was missing from the manual. Hell, for one assignment, the grading script was straight up wrong and we had to debug it and complain on the class discord for them to fix it. In summary, take him if you want good lectures, but be prepared for an overall poorly ran class."
kfu7xr8,18vr2th,2024-01-01 07:11:51,"From the stories I've heard, Professor Alvaro seems to care very little about the overall well being of his students.

His curriculum was Quin's original CSE130 curriculum as his first year as a teacher. For those who don't know, this involved a very complex multi threaded web server. From rumors that I've heard, professor Alvaro did not provide any of his students with the test cases for their grade.

I cannot begin to tell you the amount of sheer frustration and anxiety that is felt from designing a complex program with hundreds of pieces of data moving around in a concurrent multi threaded fashion and not having a single clue what you're being tested on, not having a single clue what data is being sent that's making your program fail, not having any ability to replicate the bug.

Secondly, I heard professor Alvaro fucked up majorly on his exams and refused to admit his wrong doing, but rather shrugged his shoulders and expected his students to deal with the consequences of his errors.

I also heard he doesn't wear shoes during class which is just fuckin weird."
kfwcc1n,18vr2th,2024-01-01 15:05:29,Nah he cares
kfvgndw,18vr2th,2024-01-01 11:54:33,"First, Prof. Alvaro cares deeply about students and what they learn. Computer systems is a tough subject, and many reflect their opinions of it onto the instructor. I say this because my first two offerings of CSE130 had nearly identical content, but the pilot offering was much more highly regarded. The reason? It was a smaller class, and was optional at the time (as a replacement for CS111), so the students who took it _wanted_ to be there. In most cases, your **attitude** determines your opinion about the instructor.

Oh, and the curriculum Prof. Alvaro used in his first 130 offering was mine — it was before Quinn joined the department."

kfnr5xb,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 20:50:10,I've gone to my friend's lectures before and no one has ever said anything about me being there.. I assume most professors don't care but some might. I believe there's an official process to 'Audit' a course if you wanted to do that.

kfnvcn2,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 21:24:21,As long as the class has more than like 50 people nothing is stopping you
kfo0inr,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 22:11:31,Yes I know someone who doesn’t even go to UCSC who does this casually they would show up to my class often and even raise their hand. Obvi if it’s a smaller class it prob won’t work but if it’s in a lecture hall and you’re respectful ur chillin no prof is gonna notice
kfnzff2,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 22:01:05,"Crashing(or auditing) a class depends on the professor, although I never had a problem doing so with any of my friends’ classes. 

I think for a language learning class like French you might be screwed. I took Spanish and it was a very small group with heavy emphasis on collaboration and conversing with classmates you get to know. Also all content was learned outside of class(paid textbook)."
kfqmp22,18uzjdi,2023-12-31 11:51:52,Damn I was gonna try this for Japanese 2 this winter 😭
kfnvttx,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 21:28:29,Never tried before but if the Prof doesn't take attendance you should be fine. Especially easier in the large cs classes for example.
kfppb4b,18uzjdi,2023-12-31 08:25:28,"This is called “auditing.” People are recommending that you audit large classes, presumably because it’s likely that the professor won’t even notice you, but if you chat with the professor and they give you their permission you can certainly audit smaller classes as well.

I took ornithology at UCSC, which (when I went there) was a very small (<25 people), very popular class that’s offered pretty infrequently. Because of that we had a few students in the class who got the professor’s permission to audit, because they really wanted to experience the class but it was full. You obviously don’t take any tests and don’t get credit for the class, but you can still learn!

There are also many classes from universities across the world for which all the lectures have been posted online, so if you wanted to you could “audit” one of those classes as well!"

kfpuw35,18uzjdi,2023-12-31 09:01:32,"Arrive early and introduce yourself to the prof and say you're excited about learning some things. They will be stoked. Especially considering their registered students are largely spaced out, indifferent, or MIA."
kfo3ikc,18uzjdi,2023-12-30 22:41:52,Number of seats would be the only thing really stopping you. I personally would check with the prof (to be nice) first but that’s just me.
kft1bob,18uzjdi,2023-12-31 22:58:11,"I audited many courses in my 39+ years as a professor, but I always asked permission of the instructor first.  Only once was I denied permission to sit in on a course—an intro grad course where the instructor thought that the incoming class would be intimidated by having a professor in the class (despite the fact that the grad students have about 10 times the training in the field that I had—I'd only taken one or two freshman-level courses in the field—through sitting in on them!)."

kfqnw1i,18uzjdi,2023-12-31 11:59:04,"I feel like for smaller classes you could even email the prof and explain that you are very interested in the subject and want to sit in, they’d probably allow it unless they have some capacity issue with the room they use

I remember when i visited a friend at a different school I sat in one of her classes that was like 20 ppl and it was totally chill since she told her prof before hand (sadly i did not understand anything that was going on lol)"

kfor426,18uzrm8,2023-12-31 03:32:54,I became a welcome leader and got involved with student government and clubs
kfq8i99,18uzrm8,2023-12-31 10:27:00,"Current RA here. Some tips I’d recommend:

Most importantly, Be authentic. They are looking for people who are willing to learn and put in the work. Don’t try to read off a script or lie in the interview, trust me they know.

Being a part of a student organization staff will help as it shows you have leadership skills and can manage people (essentially what an RA is tbh). Also they want to know how you handle conflict so being humble and open-minded will help. If you are someone who can’t take criticism I’d say to work on that prior to the interview. In addition, they want to know if you can work in a team. So being a team player and demonstrating that you work well in a team via resume/interview will help. 

Hope this helps."

kfqhb0t,18uzrm8,2023-12-31 11:19:21,"As a freshman, getting the RA job is a bit more difficult, but not impossible. I’d say the biggest thing is getting involved on campus in some capacity. Whether you work a part time campus job or are part of a student org or volunteer locally it will really help. I used to volunteer with the CARE office and that was something good to talk about in my interviews bc it gave me some transferable skills + CARE is a resource office often recommended to students. You don’t have to join student govt, just find something you’re interested in and work on getting experience in that."

You've spent the last 4 years in academia.  You haven't even entered the job market or spent a single minute putting your skills to practical use, so how would you expect to know any of that?  


I think a lot of students make the mistake in thinking that school is the be all to end all of knowledge. Chances are you will learn more in your first year at work then you will in all 4 years of college."
kfiljzv,18tltgy,2023-12-29 20:47:53,"I went to UCLA and also learned almost nothing practical. I learned a lot of math and science and remember a bit of it that is useful for me to understand the fundamentals of electricity (I'm an EE).

There are other universities where you learn hands on. Cal Poly for example. I know people who went there and they did tons of labs and actually built electronic components which gave them a good understanding of what they were learning.

I think we have a right to be upset with learning theory only. It means once we hit the workforce we have to learn everything on the job. Theory is useful if you want to get a grad degree."
kfxv5pn,18tltgy,2024-01-01 21:21:21,"The University of California is the State's research institute,  it's expressed purpose is to build academics with the theoretical knowledge for research.

kfy1riv,18tltgy,2024-01-01 22:21:57,"Yes I understand that. But you can teach theory and spend a small amount of time explaining how that theory applies to the real world.

I passed so many classes where I was just doing complex math I was never really told the meaning behind.

The majority of people don’t go on to be researchers or professors so maybe their model is outdated with the current number of students they have.

There’s 230k undergrads in the UC system right now. How many new researchers does California need per year? 5-10k? Very few of us go on to get PhDs"
kfggzdy,18tltgy,2023-12-29 12:04:31,"But the thing was, my lower level classes weren’t like that. Basic Newtonian physics went over actually life problems that I encounter everyday. My thermodynamics instructor was able to create problems which explained how engines and refrigerators worked. The beginning electrical courses taught practical things like how a light bulb works. Then in my upper division courses it all went to shit. We started talking about very specific things that don’t apply to any scenarios I encounter every day, like the double pendulum. The only double pendulum I’ve ever encountered in life had been the one that they built in ISB so students could see a double pendulum, because no one uses the double pendulum. They also had questions like “you have a mental sphere with a single electron in the center” ??? What is the practicality of THAT?? I feel like some of the math I am using and these problems were invented by physicists who smoked crack and then did shit like “you know how there’s one pendulum? Let’s add another” or “let’s go to my lab and add a charge to a mental sphere. Why? Who the hell knows, but at least an undergrad student will have to learn the math behind this shit.” All my classes use to be word problems that made sense: “a car driving on a road”, “a battery connected to a circuit”, “an AC unit trying to cool a house” and all those practical word problems just became abandoned for specific theoreticals in my upper division classes"
kfkcv8k,18tltgy,2023-12-30 07:40:29,"As a physics major who graduated 2 years ago, unless he goes to grad school, the OP will never use that physics knowledge again."
kfkhynm,18tltgy,2023-12-30 08:14:20,"I just don't think that's true. I'm a computer science major and I use physics knowledge nearly everyday at work. Am I calculating the potential difference of an EMF? No, but I have a good understanding of how voltage is flowing across my wiring and have used it to trouble shoot issues in the lab. I would also say that about 50% of my problem solving abilities at work have come from physics word problems."
kfkn9h4,18tltgy,2023-12-30 08:48:22,"I think if you asked a bunch of your buddies you graduated with, most would say they never touch that stuff.

I am a data analyst. I think we have the tendency to go into some type of data field, which has nothing to do with physics. There is a lot of stats, but unless you do a deep dive into data science, the math is trivial.

EDIT: I said I graduated two years ago. I graduated a year and a half ago."
kfmptc8,18tltgy,2023-12-30 16:35:47,"this! even though your classes ranges from 100-500, it's all really 101 in the big scheme of things"
kffhws8,18tltgy,2023-12-29 08:33:06,Seems like you are asking about electrical engineering which is where you would apply all of that.
kfh7ve6,18tltgy,2023-12-29 14:52:58,"I have a physics bachelor's and an astronomy PhD, and I think there are two possible ways I could interpret all the thoughts you're having now:

1. Maybe what you really want is to be an engineer. That's where you take relatively simple ""intro"" ideas like Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics and apply them to answer complex questions in real life. Not saying that engineering simple or easy, just that the underlying physics is not the upper level stuff like advanced E&M or quantum or whatever that is harder to touch with your own hands, and the interesting problems come from complex systems and the interactions within them rather than pure difficult concepts. If this applies to you, maybe consider an engineering masters. (side note: most research is similar to engineering in that you have a few basic concepts that you explore very deeply, so you only need a very focused area of expertise rather than a broad-based understanding. This is why grad students probably say that they don't use the material from whatever class you're talking about very often.)

2. You may need to sit down and think about what motivated you to be a physicist in the first place. Generally, people don't make it through a whole physics degree unless they have an innate interest in understanding more about the universe and how it works through solving problems. For me, having a broad understanding of the way *things* function and the systems in the entire world is very satisfying, and that makes it worth it to do very abstract problems. Knowing how electric fields propagate through a dielectric material isn't usually applied, but if I think about why the sky looks less blue on a smoky day or why a piece of calcite exhibits birefringence, then I remember my undergrad E&M classes and have the physics framework to understand it. I may not ever calculate Lagrangians of double pendulums anymore, but having that background gives me the ability to intuit whether a system I see in daily life may be chaotic. The things you're learning as a physicist aren't necessarily the content of the classes, but the way of thinking, and I guarantee you that if you've made it to the end, then you have a very good ability to see a system in the real world and simplify it into a model in your head so you can relate it to the things you already know. To me, that is the most satisfying and beautiful thing in physics.

So if what you want is applications, go engineering (or research or lab work or programming or whatever). But if you want simplicity and understanding, then I bet you've learned more than you though you did."
kfjzbaf,18tltgy,2023-12-30 05:58:31,"This is by and far the best answer.

Thank you for writing this out, I really appreciated it."
kfljnov,18tltgy,2023-12-30 12:06:37,"Perfect response. Physics equips us with problem solving skills, and engineering/research is a great place to put that to use. I switched my career goals before I graduated because I knew some type of engineering would be more fulfilling for me!"
kfgbrh1,18tltgy,2023-12-29 11:32:51,If you have any electives left take one of the applied physics classes. And like someone said look into grad school 👍🏿
kfpxd22,18tltgy,2023-12-31 09:17:18,Yeah I think op’s missing the application of what they’re learning
kfimuj1,18tltgy,2023-12-29 20:58:53,Such is the difference between theory and application! I felt similarly frustrated with my theoretical classes because we didn’t even delve into theory that was recent whereas my applied classes we were actually creating things and having conversations about how theory in practice impacts people & the things around us. Consider every theory class you’ve ever taken as the base knowledge you’ll need to be able to put into practice to problem solve at a job
kfjaj3v,18tltgy,2023-12-30 01:16:16,"Hey! First off, I feel you. It can be really hard to learn a bunch of theory without knowing why you're learning that stuff. A physics course has failed when it has only taught you the math and not the physical systems that it pertains to. The problem with a lot of E&M and Q. Mech is that real systems tend to be a lot more complex than most undergrad level theoretical models and so there are quite a few more advanced courses that you have to take before you get to explain some real physical systems. E.g. take atomic and molecular spectra that I deal with on a regular basis as an Astrophysics grad student. Although the time independent Schrodinger equation sets the foundation for atomic lines, there's a bunch more theory that deals with how light interacts with atoms before you start explaining the shape of atomic transitions and subsequently emission lines. Similarly in E&M, a lot of real life situations deal with collections of charges and thus their behavior is truly explained through a combination of statistical mechanics and electrodynamics. However, even the simple static, time-independent models are pretty close to the behavior of many many made systems, especially in electronics and electrical systems. Take for instance, QLED TVs. The Q part of the LED is basically a real life quantum particle in a box example. By changing the size of the box, you can tune the frequency if the light emission. Dielectrics are all around you. You have to worry about the material properties of air when designing electrical fuses. Coaxial cables have dielectrics in them. I can go on but hopefully you get the point. 

You mentioned that your interactions with grad students gave you the impression that these equations are largely useless. A lot of grads feel that way because they tend to focus on a niche problem many a times brushes the fundamental physics under the rug. My own research for instance deals more with CCD data (basically photographs) processing but it is very important for me to not lose track of the underlying physics. That's what I have an advisor for. :) He reminds me constantly of why I'm doing what I'm doing and forces me to think first about the science, i.e. the physical system I'm trying to understand, than  the methodology, i.e. the theory and the implementation of it.

It sounds like there were not enough lab classes in your curriculum which had you model real physical systems, especially electrical circuits, with all the theory you've learnt. May I know which lab classes you took?

Also, I'm more than happy to point you towards relevant physical systems that can be explained by the theory you've learnt. DM me if you're interested in have a conversation."
kfm07s3,18tltgy,2023-12-30 13:50:58,Thank you for this response! You have given me more context to my current classes than I have ever had in the past couple years. I’ve taken both PHYS 133 and 134 here as my lab classes
kfmlfgy,18tltgy,2023-12-30 16:07:17,"Happy to help. I'm an international student so am unaware of the experiments in those two lab courses but I'm hoping they have at least some physical systems that you learnt in your theory classes in them. If not, there's a true need for coordination between the lab and theory instructors."
kffd1ip,18tltgy,2023-12-29 08:02:57,Grad school...
kfgma5v,18tltgy,2023-12-29 12:36:43,"Grad students I speak to about this usually say they never use the math we learned, or if they do it’s already built into a program on Jupyter notebooks or mat lab"
kfgofsl,18tltgy,2023-12-29 12:49:55,Of course it is. But still good to know how to write it out and be old school. Sometimes the models glitch and you have to validate your data.

kffwycl,18tltgy,2023-12-29 10:03:58,"My undergrad also felt like scattered bits of knowledge that had little cohesiveness, unless you were able to steer your classes to your liking"

You have demonstrated your ability to do this so someone can hire you and trust that you can learn how to do a thing in a certain domain, then do something with that information"
kfffz3i,18tltgy,2023-12-29 08:21:08,"Exactly my sentiments! Grad school makes this dilemma even more less practical, applicable, esoteric and specialized where you are focusing and thinking about a hyper niche part of science for 4 years."

kfgm5rx,18tltgy,2023-12-29 12:35:58,Yeah I also ask grad student about these equations I’m learning (because none of them come up in our research) and they are like “oh yeah the last time I used that math was for my undergrad course.” It’s just like why am I learning this?

kfgxui2,18tltgy,2023-12-29 13:48:46,You’re probably in the nice practical classes right now. Everything I learned the first two years was cool and exciting (hence why I picked it as my major) after that it feels like I’m learning garbage. Enjoy learning actual stuff while it lasts!
kfihy12,18tltgy,2023-12-29 20:18:26,"Pretty much every major ever is the same, its a check mark in life. Wait until you have to compete experience wise for a decent career. What kind of research projects are you working on and is it related to the career you are looking to break into?"
kfg8su6,18tltgy,2023-12-29 11:14:47,"I felt like this during my Politics classes. 90% of the material was regurgitating material I learned in high school, APUSH or APGOV, or just riffing off Foucault. 
For anthropology, the only repeated material was basic biology; otherwise, everything was new information.
Writing classes also fail to utilize the small class settings we have by so much. I learned very little about good writing in undergrad that didn't come from reading other good writers."

I felt like it was a big waste of time and money, could have boot camped and self taught a good 90% of it and still have the same skills/knowledge /income and career. Lol"
kfr6yv4,18tltgy,2023-12-31 13:56:14,"You won't use Astrophysics unless you go into academia, that's why they offer the Applied Physics B.S. I chose the route and found myself applying the things I learned rather quickly in my first job out of college. 

If they still have it, I highly recommend taking the Physicist in Industry course.  I don't know how it is structured now, but when I took it, they would have physics alumni come in and speak about their life and career."
kg1gcu1,18tltgy,2024-01-02 14:16:45,"Is your degree program oriented towards people who want to pursue a PhD research on theoretical models? If so, then your undergrad coursework might be missing applied projects. Talk to someone in the department about your interest in the applied side of physics and see what they suggest.

There are usually collab opportunities with engineering departments for applied physics and applied mathematics. There's also materials science if you found solid state coursework interesting. 

You may also need to dig deeper into a niche of astrophysics (e.g. adaptive optics in astronomical telescopes) to find practical applications that interest you."
kg3lrjx,18tltgy,2024-01-02 23:51:07,"I agree with you 100%. The physics department is terrible when it comes to application and for students that don't plan on pursuing grad school. It's not very helpful to know theory without a use case, especially in interviews for internships/jobs. If professors could provide some background information on each weekly homework describing an example of when you might see this it would be a huge improvement.

That being said, physics is just one of those fields that requires a PhD. to truly put to work all of the theory. A BS is barely scratching the surface and is primarily geared towards developing your foundation for graduate level courses. You won't get much of the application side other than in your electives, and even then 10 weeks is much too quick to grasp the various topics. If you're able to squeeze in a minor I would do an applied math minor if you find the computational side interesting or maybe EE if it doesn't delay graduation.

I'm graduating after this Winter quarter (Applied Physics with Applied Math Minor) and I feel as if everything I've learned throughout my physics BS has finally prepared me to start a BS in Physics lol.

I would recommend applying to numerous internships in fields of your interest, and also further developing any coding skills you have. Python and Matlab skills always look good on a resume."
kfiljzv,18tltgy,2023-12-29 20:47:53,"I went to UCLA and also learned almost nothing practical. I learned a lot of math and science and remember a bit of it that is useful for me to understand the fundamentals of electricity (I'm an EE).

There are other universities where you learn hands on. Cal Poly for example. I know people who went there and they did tons of labs and actually built electronic components which gave them a good understanding of what they were learning.

I think we have a right to be upset with learning theory only. It means once we hit the workforce we have to learn everything on the job. Theory is useful if you want to get a grad degree."

kfy1riv,18tltgy,2024-01-01 22:21:57,"Yes I understand that. But you can teach theory and spend a small amount of time explaining how that theory applies to the real world.

I passed so many classes where I was just doing complex math I was never really told the meaning behind.

There’s 230k undergrads in the UC system right now. How many new researchers does California need per year? 5-10k? Very few of us go on to get PhDs"
kfggzdy,18tltgy,2023-12-29 12:04:31,"But the thing was, my lower level classes weren’t like that. Basic Newtonian physics went over actually life problems that I encounter everyday. My thermodynamics instructor was able to create problems which explained how engines and refrigerators worked. The beginning electrical courses taught practical things like how a light bulb works. Then in my upper division courses it all went to shit. We started talking about very specific things that don’t apply to any scenarios I encounter every day, like the double pendulum. The only double pendulum I’ve ever encountered in life had been the one that they built in ISB so students could see a double pendulum, because no one uses the double pendulum. They also had questions like “you have a mental sphere with a single electron in the center” ??? What is the practicality of THAT?? I feel like some of the math I am using and these problems were invented by physicists who smoked crack and then did shit like “you know how there’s one pendulum? Let’s add another” or “let’s go to my lab and add a charge to a mental sphere. Why? Who the hell knows, but at least an undergrad student will have to learn the math behind this shit.” All my classes use to be word problems that made sense: “a car driving on a road”, “a battery connected to a circuit”, “an AC unit trying to cool a house” and all those practical word problems just became abandoned for specific theoreticals in my upper division classes"

kfbgwrg,18szpf7,2023-12-28 12:55:38,"GPAs are dumb.
  
I remember my CSE114A grade consisted mostly of exams. Right before the midterm, the instructor said that somebody in a previous quarter complained it was too easy, so she made ours harder. She released the previous one, which I did and felt more than comfortable with. When I took the actual midterm, I didn't do nearly as well, and long story short, I got a C. I think it's hard to say who had a stronger understanding of the subject content based on GPA between the two quarters.
  
 I think the same could be said for Quinn's CSE130; his earlier offers were significantly more difficult, and an earlier A isn't truly equivalent to a later A."

You have 3 job offers. That's impressive! It took me a year after college to get a job in my field. And the market back then was much less difficult to get a job in. Right now, many tech companies have hiring freezes and are laying off employees. So the tech employee market is saturated right now. More competition. And you have 3 offers! Go celebrate!"

kfcsyew,18szpf7,2023-12-28 18:03:40,"Hi, tech recruiter here! First of all, that’s a great GPA and I wouldn’t worry about it. Second, tech companies are caring less and less about GPAs and where you go to school. Partially because it hinders their ability to hire for diversity (less diversity at IV leagues, students coming from low income families needing to work while studying, etc) and bottom line, it just doesn’t matter as long as you’re a good engineer. Get good experience, work on substantial projects, work on side projects, and work up to having enough “stories” or situations to talk about in interviews. IMO if a company cares about your GPA it might not be a great culture. Not saying you shouldn’t take a job because of that, you’ll likely gain valuable experience working for a less than ideal culture too which will help you find something you really love."

kfc4j3r,18t7lps,2023-12-28 15:19:26,CSE180 this fall quarter had 90% weighting on exams with minor curves (the other 10% was freebie homework you could get a full score on with unlimited attempts). the concepts themselves were easy enough with practice but the exams could lead to sudden death situations.
kfc73z1,18t7lps,2023-12-28 15:36:34,"150 with Parsa lecture/lab attendance is 3% of your grade each. There are also “pop” quizzes during lectures that are worth 10% of the grade. There is a pre-lab/lab every 2 weeks that is basically the entire workload for the class outside the final project. I wouldn’t say the class is easy, but it’s very very doable when compared to other upper level cs courses. Parsa is kind of an asshole though"
kfcdcse,18t7lps,2023-12-28 16:18:24,That's the first I heard that about Parsa. Before I had only heard that 80N with her was easy. What does she do?
kfdx60y,18t7lps,2023-12-28 23:38:06,"Super nitpicky with the labs. Will take off points for stupid stuff. If you get sick at all she will not give a single shit or give you anyway to make up material. You could be dying in the hospital, but if you miss quizzes/midterm she will give you a 0. There was a large curve when I took it, but outside that she will go out of her way to reduce your point total."
kfci53c,18t7lps,2023-12-28 16:50:44,"150 with Parsa is so unnecessarily stressful and filled with bullshit. Topic wise it’s not difficult material. Assignment and project wise, it’s all self taught as the instructions are barely helpful. 

The material and assignments for that class is set up is in a way that causes obvious problems to happen; which the teaching staff uses to dock points whenever possible. I’m not even kidding they will nitpick very minor things just to dock points for things that are not related to the course material at all.

In other cases where you did make a mistake, they will not provide any explanation as to what you did wrong. So hopefully you figure it out without making another mistake else good luck on the midterm/final. 

They have lecture slides and thankfully upload them to canvas, but unfortunately she makes annotations to them that often contains critical information which aren't included in the upload.

Despite all of this stress and unnecessary bullshit. She still curved the class way beyond my expectations (I had pessimistic expectations). I guess they account for the bullshit by having that GPA saving curve at the end but my god was it such an unnecessarily stressful class. 

Comparing CSE 101 with Tantalo vs CSE 150 with Parsa is a night and day difference."
kfcnktz,18t7lps,2023-12-28 17:27:38,"If you don't mind attending lecture and reading the book then 150 is very doable. Chris is somewhat weird about locking down the assignments and the labs may take you some time but otherwise the class isn't terribly difficult.

kf92k87,18sq6bl,2023-12-28 02:45:16,"There are a few requirements to meet in regards to residency for the purpose of in state tuition.

1. You need to by physically in California for over a year BEFORE the start residency determination which is generally the first day of class
2. Establish intent to stay to remain in California
3. Financial Independence
4. Immigration Status being either a citizen or a non-immigrant visa

It seems like your working on 2 and 3 while I have no idea what your status is based on 4 so I won't comment. Your main problem is 1 in that you need to have been already living here for more than a year before you even qualify for it. For the UC system, they determine what your residency information is based on your parents if you are a dependent otherwise you'd need to provide proof of a primary and permanent place of residence. From what I know extended family isn't considered when taking into account residency so I'm afraid using your aunt would most likely lead to nowhere unless you can prove that you lived with your aunt which goes back to the ""living here for 1 year"" problem.

That being said, I suppose you could still try, but I wouldn't have high expectations for the outcome."

So it’s easier if you get a job first before you come here, then you can say you originally came for work and then decided to go to university. (So you’ll want to apply for university a year later or so)."
kfajz1l,18sq6bl,2023-12-28 09:40:30,"Grad students and undergrads have different rules about establishing residency, and the rules are clearly explained on the website—look them up rather than relying on the slightly inaccurate reports here."

Difficult to do if your parents provide significant support. You’ll also need to get a CA license / ID, register to vote in CA, and stay here over the summer. Alternatively, you can get an exemption from residency if you attended a CA high school for 3 years.

See https://ucop.edu/residency/index.html for details."

kfbddzm,18sq6bl,2023-12-28 12:34:48,"If you are financially independent from your parents (which is easier than most people think it is if you have savings purely in your own name), and can document that you have been physically present in California for a year for reasons that are not exclusively for education, then you can be a resident for tuition purposes.

The easiest way to do this is to hold a (taxed) job in California and have a documented, signed lease that begins more than one year before you intend to enroll.  You also have to break ties with any other place -- so if you own a car, it needs to be registered in CA.  You need to register to vote here and vote, etc. etc.

Every year, a number of out-of-state students become in-state prior to their second or (more commonly) third year.  It takes some work and you need to be intentional about it, but it can be done.

There is tons more information from official sources:   
[UCSC registrar's page](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/fees/residency/).  [UC office of President's page](https://www.ucop.edu/residency/establishing-residency.html).

The UCOP page has a fairly definitive checklist of the requirements.  UCSC can help answer your questions about how that checklist is interpreted at this campus, and what paper trails you'll need to show that you're following it.

The folks on the other side of the [reg-residency@ucsc.edu](mailto:reg-residency@ucsc.edu) email address are the actual people who make residency determinations.  If you have a question that isn't answered already on the registrar's site or UCOP, ask them instead of listening to randos on the internet like me."

kfaf5mb,18sq6bl,2023-12-28 09:12:15,"I agree with the other comments. UC has a strict policy around this and treats it as a form of loss prevention to investigate and ensure all non-CA students pay out-of-state tuition. In some cases, departments will pay the first year of out-of-state tuition as part of a financial aid package, but this must be determined prior to your acceptance of an offer to attend."

First,
Switch your address to your aunts house or new cali house on your bank account/ any proof of residence papers

Then get a californja drivers license/id card 1 year prior to reclassifications

Show California tax payments as well. 

All these documents should be provided for the past year and you should most likely be good, but beware the department is stingy if something seems off so be careful."

kf3tzie,18rwd06,2023-12-27 02:15:19,"It has nothing to do with “getting a chance,” and everything to do with “is my application competitive?” Not being from California isn’t going to hurt your chances as much as being an average student will. Most if not all admissions statistics are available online if you want to get an idea of where incoming students are coming from. Yes, the majority is likely CCC but not 100%."
kf5j84m,18rwd06,2023-12-27 10:18:33,"yeah i've already looked at the stats online, that's the reason im woried. it's over 90% ccc students that get in for transfer. and when i was applying to colleges initially i was an average student and i got in to every single one, because i applied to school with 40-50% acceptance rates, the rate for ucsc is 60%+, so generally that's not insanely competitive in my opinion and i wouldn't be worried if it worried for the 90% are from ccc thing. so it is kinda about getting a chance. i fear that the less then 10% of other transfer students they let in are either from other uc schools or still california residents"
kf5y79r,18rwd06,2023-12-27 11:47:45,"In California community colleges we have something called IGETC which makes it easy (or at least… easIER) for California CC students to transfer to all and any UCs (https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/). 

There is a component of completing the IGETC requirements that generally makes a CCC student priority for transfer. However, that doesn’t mean that these are the ONLY students who get in. It is important you understand that this is how the entire UC system works and it is not actually specific to UCSC.

That said, if you are an average student who does not have a competitive application in comparison to the other out-of-state transfers then it’s pretty unlikely you will get in. I hope you do and wish you the best of luck, so hopefully your application was pretty good. You never know! 

So, it really just depends on your personal qualities and how you represented that in your application!

Edit: also I want to echo what the other user said and point out it has nothing to do with being “given a chance”. It is simply not true that they “don’t give other people a chance”. This is incorrect (and quite frankly, unhelpful)."
kf6elpr,18rwd06,2023-12-27 13:26:07,"thanks for your insight! i understand that it's not only ccc students that get in, but it is about 94% which is a scary number to look at. im more just saying that as an average student not from california or a ccc i feel my application won't get much consideration because i am average and also not a ccc student. i didn't think saying that would be so controversial since it explicitly states that ccc students have priority. i was just hoping to get some insight from non ccc transfers. but thank you for the well wishes i really appreciate that!"
kf7qya1,18rwd06,2023-12-27 18:45:25,Pretty sure the stats r skewed towards a majority transfers being from ccc’s because most of their applicants come from these schools. How often do you hear out of state students transferring to a UC? Most don’t. That’s where you’re getting 94%
kf86f8g,18rwd06,2023-12-27 20:43:08,"i mean UCs are pretty popular so i can imagine a lot of people want to transfer to them, on their website they say that ccc students get priority for transferring and based on remaining spots they may admit other students. im sure that ccc students make up the majority of their applicant pool but its probably closer to 60, maybe 70, i wouldn't say its 94 but i do understand what you're getting at"
kf3u3me,18rwd06,2023-12-27 02:16:47,"I transferred from a non CCC, but I’m a CA resident. I transferred from an out of state private college.

I got myself real scared because all of the data I was able to see was from CCC transfers or the rare UC/UC transfer - I will tell you that you’ll have a hard time comparing yourself to other people because your stats will be considered in a different light than a community college transfer would be. However, try not to let it scare you too much - either you get in or you don’t. I will tell you, a lot of my credits didn’t transfer (not a ton, but enough to set me back 2 quarters :() but this depends heavily on where you transfer from.

Is your major impacted? Is your GPA good? are you a CA resident? Non CA residents don’t get aid, and from what I’ve heard that increases your odds since you give them more money ;)"
kf5kpjn,18rwd06,2023-12-27 10:27:19,"what year did you transfer in? i'll be coming in with a year and a half under my belt so im expcting to go in as a sophomore and do 3 years from there which is ok with me. i've seen mixed things about the non residents giving them more money, but it seems different for transfer for some reason. thank you for your insight though"
kf5s5qh,18rwd06,2023-12-27 11:11:33,"last year was my first year here, I had about 70 semester credits (so I was 10 credits over a sophomore) and I expected to be able to graduate in 2 years but I’ll have to do 2 extra quarters. however this very much depends on where you transfer from of course, I transferred from a tiny, low ranking private college in the middle of nowhere so I didn’t really have high hopes.

I will say junior transfers tend to have better odds as I believe UCSC, UCR and UCM (?) are the only UCs that take sophomore transfers, and they’re lower priority, so keep that in mind. Doesn’t mean you won’t get in though.

I posted a lot on college confidential trying to get stats on if I’d get in or not and everyone was so mean hahha, they all told me I wouldn’t get in since I’m out of state - despite my good GPA and high amount of credits. it is true that something like 5% of applicants are non CCC, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you have a 5% chance of getting in."
kf6b2xy,18rwd06,2023-12-27 13:05:15,"that's all very helpful thank you! i think i should just wait it out, it doesn't seem like posting on forums will be too helpful, i was just hoping for people like you to share your experience. it seems like i might not get in just because the amount of non ccc students is so low but there's no way to know until i get decision. thank you for sympathizing with me!"
kf6d12u,18rwd06,2023-12-27 13:16:47,"yes please I’m begging you don’t post on forums it’ll drive you insane. even if there’s only a 1% chance you’ll get in, at the end of the day you get in or don’t and nobody can say for sure except for the UC admissions staff once they send you an acceptance or denial lol. but of course if you have any other questions about transferring feel free to ask me. I only met about one or two other people online who transferred from out of state, and maybe 2 people irl who transferred from CSUs.

are you coming from an out of state public or private college? is it pretty large/well known or no? this can impact your credit transferability sometimes. I’d recommend checking Transferology."
kf6p3gh,18rwd06,2023-12-27 14:30:39,"thank you! im coming from a sort of well known public school but it's more of an art school. i'll be coming in with 51 semester credits which is almost 2 full years of credits. i know that most of them will probably just transfer as electives and a few gen ed requirements and some of them wont transfer, which is no problem for me. i have already had to overload classes so i don't care if i have todo that again in order to .graduate in a more timely manner, even though i'm hoping i won't have to considering how many credits i have to be applying as a second year transfer."
kf640gl,18rwd06,2023-12-27 12:22:41,"If you have average grades and aren't looking to get into the Computer Science program, you'll get in. The university WANTS out of state residents!"
kf6erkr,18rwd06,2023-12-27 13:27:06,i hope you're right!
kf8mrea,18rwd06,2023-12-27 23:26:37,"Not really, last year the UC’s made a resolution to increase the number of in-state students. Before, non-residents made up about 25% of all students, and the state wanted to lower that number."
kf5767n,18rwd06,2023-12-27 09:07:00,"just move to CA, become a resident (so you’re eligible for in-state tuition), attend a local community college for a semester or two and then transfer."
kf5k7xj,18rwd06,2023-12-27 10:24:26,"in theory this is a great idea but up and leaving and spending a year in another place where i don't know anyone just to get in to a college is probably not the best option for me, also the qualifications for in state at uc schools are so complex and it seems like you have to live there for 3 years if im not mistaken"
kf5kdvm,18rwd06,2023-12-27 10:25:24,"nah, you become eligible for in-state after one year. my housemate did just that. unless the rules have changed?"
kf6fjwb,18rwd06,2023-12-27 13:31:51,"hm im not sure, it said something on the application about 3 years but the whole thing confused me. either way i think id rathe go somewhere else then wait a year to get in to a school. thank you though!"
kf6ow34,18rwd06,2023-12-27 14:29:19,"The rules are complicated, and the are different for grad students, independent students, and students who are still dependents of their parents or guardians.  I think there may be some extra rules for students in the foster-care system and for students without documentation proving their right to residency in the US."
kf7e966,18rwd06,2023-12-27 17:17:37,"i applied to transfer to a handful of ucs from out of state private school, got rejected from most of them because I did not have the credits to match the CC to UC IGETC metric (due to weird/unique structure of my previous schools freshman curriculum). UCSC was the only one willing to tell me what I missed, and offered winter admit if I finished the credits through community college. was stoked. will say it takes a lot of effort on your part even after transferring to make sense of how non cc courses transfer/what you need to graduate. 
not impossible, just more effort. “navigating uc bureaucracy” still not offered for credit unfortch"
kf86wyg,18rwd06,2023-12-27 20:47:21,that is very great to hear! but yeah it really does seem like their transfer process is completely ridiculous. what year did you transfer to? im hoping that it wont be as bad as a second year transfer but that also might make it harder to get in i dont know.

kflqkf7,18rwd06,2023-12-30 12:49:48,I know people who transferred from a university in Texas.
kf5j84m,18rwd06,2023-12-27 10:18:33,"yeah i've already looked at the stats online, that's the reason im woried. it's over 90% ccc students that get in for transfer. and when i was applying to colleges initially i was an average student and i got in to every single one, because i applied to school with 40-50% acceptance rates, the rate for ucsc is 60%+, so generally that's not insanely competitive in my opinion and i wouldn't be worried if it worried for the 90% are from ccc thing. so it is kinda about getting a chance. i fear that the less then 10% of other transfer students they let in are either from other uc schools or still california residents"
kf5y79r,18rwd06,2023-12-27 11:47:45,"In California community colleges we have something called IGETC which makes it easy (or at least… easIER) for California CC students to transfer to all and any UCs (https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/). 

There is a component of completing the IGETC requirements that generally makes a CCC student priority for transfer. However, that doesn’t mean that these are the ONLY students who get in. It is important you understand that this is how the entire UC system works and it is not actually specific to UCSC.

That said, if you are an average student who does not have a competitive application in comparison to the other out-of-state transfers then it’s pretty unlikely you will get in. I hope you do and wish you the best of luck, so hopefully your application was pretty good. You never know! 

So, it really just depends on your personal qualities and how you represented that in your application!

Edit: also I want to echo what the other user said and point out it has nothing to do with being “given a chance”. It is simply not true that they “don’t give other people a chance”. This is incorrect (and quite frankly, unhelpful)."

kf6p3gh,18rwd06,2023-12-27 14:30:39,"thank you! im coming from a sort of well known public school but it's more of an art school. i'll be coming in with 51 semester credits which is almost 2 full years of credits. i know that most of them will probably just transfer as electives and a few gen ed requirements and some of them wont transfer, which is no problem for me. i have already had to overload classes so i don't care if i have todo that again in order to .graduate in a more timely manner, even though i'm hoping i won't have to considering how many credits i have to be applying as a second year transfer."
kf86f8g,18rwd06,2023-12-27 20:43:08,"i mean UCs are pretty popular so i can imagine a lot of people want to transfer to them, on their website they say that ccc students get priority for transferring and based on remaining spots they may admit other students. im sure that ccc students make up the majority of their applicant pool but its probably closer to 60, maybe 70, i wouldn't say its 94 but i do understand what you're getting at"

kf30tsh,18rqeiq,2023-12-26 20:44:25,"Both experiences I’ve had with Alvaro (assuming you’re talking about Peter) and Veenstra have been pretty good! Alvaro is a very experienced and understanding professor, so he’s definitely not a bad choice. Veenstra has great lectures and good review for exams, but also doesn’t grade anything until the VERY last minute. 

I just took CSE130 with Veenstra and he taught well, but we didn’t get our first midterm grades back until the end of the class. Despite this, Veenstra is a super nice guy. Alvaro has great connections to distributed systems labs on campus, so talking to him would be great if you’re into that sort of thing. He’s also super nice!

Either way, CSE13S has BY FAR been the hardest class I’ve ever taken, and it’s not even close. I took 13S with Miller, followed by Long, and it pretty much consumed my entire life and sent me into a deep depression for two quarters.

So, just start early with the assignments, like DAY OF, and grind your heart out for the exams. 13S will be the hardest class you take at this school. (unless these new professors changed the curriculum or something)

Best of luck!"

I think most people’s experience is that they make friends with people in their classes and then immediately lose touch after that class is over. Then they meet the same people in their next class, and continue the friendship until that class is also over.

Best bet is to just take it easy, focus on passing your classes and graduating early, and then make forever friends afterwards- most people are going to move out of Santa Cruz after graduation anyways, and after that it’s gonna be really hard to keep in touch :("

Coming in with an open mind the willingness to commit to activities greatly helps make friends quick. That’s how I got connected during my years there. 

The other unconventional way that I did was take the initiative to make large study group chats and go to all office hours. A lot of my friends made were through impromptu discussions about class work or walking through some concept. Afterwards, we sometimes grabbed a bite to eat a the dining hall to further connect.

kez6ht3,18qwfjr,2023-12-26 03:49:47,Clubs. It’s easier to build connections if you have something in common with people and there is an excuse to be at the same place as them at the same time.
kezivwg,18qwfjr,2023-12-26 06:00:00,Get a part time job off or on campus this is how I made friends in college as a transfer student and 20 years later I am still friends with some.
kf19mlm,18qwfjr,2023-12-26 13:09:09,I am a transfer student! It took me also a year to make a friend. I met my friends through bumble friends. Other friends I made through classes and one friend I met at an event at 11th hour. My advice is to not see it as something that is wrong with you! Many people make friends their first year at UCSC through dorms. If you don't have the typical experience or didn't have good dormmates then it's harder. You just need to find where people like you hang out!
kf34aa1,18qwfjr,2023-12-26 21:14:58,One time I was about to go to leave the CS assembly and sat down to wait and meet up with a friend. I noticed someone sitting next to me and I had time to pass so I just chatted them up. We're still friends to this day

Join clubs or events aligned with your interests, attend social gatherings, and don't hesitate to initiate conversations."
kf5z39l,18qwfjr,2023-12-27 11:52:57,"In my experience, at UCSC, people are often friends with people from a similar national origin, etc. Maybe try being friends with someone from a country (or from other group) that is not very common at your major or at UCSC? To me, it was tricky finding friends in my department, in part because everyone was friends with others from a similar national origin, mostly with people of the same gender, etc. Someone who came recently to UCSC and whose national origin (or other category, such as race, gender, disability, etc) is not very common at UCSC or at your major might appreciate it as well."

kfesuor,18qwfjr,2023-12-29 05:40:50,"lets look at the top 3 reasons for successful relationships  


\#1 Money - food and alcohol is a really good catalyst for getting people together, things like board games, karaoke machines, can generate entertainment and value to a party, having a car or large apartment can open opportunities as well. 

\# 2 Distance - Simply being in a club or team with people will increase the likely hood they will befriend you, people are more likely to make friends that are convenient.

\#3 Morals and Values - People tend to gravitate towards those that have a digestible set of morals and values, don't share your overly opinionated ideas with people and try to always be a reasonable person who reacts appropriately to your environment."

keynoks,18r2lth,2023-12-25 23:28:44,LSS tutor here. All applications for tutoring for the winter quarter have been submitted so you would need to wait until spring quarter. (I know that Baskins has tutors but I know nothing about that so I won’t touch on it) however LSS will not hire you to tutoring course taught in high school or CC. You are eligible to tutor for a class completed at UCSC if you earned a B or higher. If you have no tutoring experience the pedagogy course is extremely helpful. Also it is a mandatory course to take in order to be a tutor so you would need to take it either way
kf11t1z,18r2lth,2023-12-26 12:18:57,"Okay, thank you! Very helpful"
kfjhfxe,18r2lth,2023-12-30 02:46:14,"As above mentioned, you aren’t eligible unless you’ve taken the class at UCSC. Also, the pedagogy course is required (and a tremendous waste of time, but a very easy couple of credits). As a former tutor however, I would point out that it’s hard to make very much money from the job. At least as a small group tutor, you max out at around 10 hours a week, on the very best week. If you want it for your resume go for it, but it’s a kinda shitty job."

the new hosting solution *fucking sucks*

It's a nightmare to log into just to maintain a simple HTML page. I asked IT why they did this, since the new 'solution' is way harder to use than the old one, and the answer was (and I quote), ""Regarding the reason for the migration, there is a campuswide initiative to move all computer servers off campus **at the direction of the Chancellor**""

I don't think the Chancellor is qualified to make IT decisions...

Once I am able to actually log in, I'm just going to set it up to do a permanent redirect to my self-hosted site. I highly recommend digital ocean, it's like $5/mo and super easy to use and I have never had a problem with them in over 10 years."

ken6ltq,18pa07d,2023-12-23 10:56:52,"Yes, just apply. Study for the GRE and go for the high marks. Good luck.
Edit: 1000% apply, I had a lower GPA and got into grad school and guess what I've done much better so don't let anyone discourage you! Apply to internships like crazy and make a discord for all your master classes so you have a study group."
kemyfno,18pa07d,2023-12-23 10:02:51,GPA is one of many factors. No one can answer you definitively either way.
kena2c6,18pa07d,2023-12-23 11:19:59,"One thing to keep in mind is that very few astrophysics programs accept masters-only students. They almost always accept only doctoral students.

The other thing to keep in mind is that master students do not get financial support, as in they have to pay for their own tuition. PhD students get their tuition covered by the program.

Usually the way you get a master's degree in astrophysics is along the way to a PhD."
kenb4oc,18pa07d,2023-12-23 11:27:12,They asked about physics not astrophysics
kenho7b,18pa07d,2023-12-23 12:12:01,"It's pretty much the same thing in terms of qualifying for a program.  Unless you are going to a state university that only has masters programs as its highest degree, it'll be harder to get in. That's the way it works at UC at least."

keoyjb9,18pa07d,2023-12-23 18:40:23,"I had a slightly higher GPA when I graduated physics from Davis. Don't take this as a bashing comment, but you might want to reconsider graduate school. If you couldn't keep up in undergrad, you will probably have a bigger challenge in grad school. 

Why not take a few years off working... Then, during that period of time, go back and master everything you learned."
ken3ofb,18pa07d,2023-12-23 10:37:24,Not really. The astrophysicists I know all had 4.0 or above.

keq7o3n,18pqyp8,2023-12-24 02:57:27,"The fact you think CC is worthy of killing yourself tells me that you know very little how education/college actually works. In terms of getting into ucsc. I would say you have a solid chance but it’ll still be expensive even with decent fafsa. So if you’re gonna end up taking out loans anyway the money shouldn’t be a consideration imo. Given you get a ROI, which with an EE degree is highly likely. I digress. I hope you’re joking about the suicide part, if you are that adverse of the alternatives in case of no admission to UCSC, then take your scholarship. the risk is probably not worth it if it ends with you jumping off a bridge."
kerr2pg,18pqyp8,2023-12-24 10:46:15,"Seriously. I’m not a UCSC alumni, but I did transfer out of a CC to Cal Poly for a Comp Eng degree. Best decision of my life. Owed practically nothing for the first 2 years of schooling and I was able to intern at JPL no less as a CC student.

kevrino,18pqyp8,2023-12-25 09:25:30,"If you think you want a shot at computer science, your best bet is to do two years at community college with the right transferable courses—you have a better chance of getting into CS that way than as a frosh. Especially as you did not list CS as your first choice.

Of course, you have to go to one of the CCs that is good at transfer to UC (Santa Monica, De Anza, Diablo, … ).  See [https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/california-community-college-new-enrollments-uc](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/california-community-college-new-enrollments-uc)  Any college transferring 150 or more students a year to UC is doing ok, but if you are in a rural area with few CC choices, you may need to go a bit further down the list."

kesprlp,18pqyp8,2023-12-24 14:44:01,"Community College then transferring to the college you want is almost always better regardless. It’s cheaper, classes are smaller, and you have a better chance of admission to high-ranking schools than applying right out of high school.

The only reason not to take that option is if you get accepted into a hyper-competitive college like Berkeley or Stanford off the rip and don’t want to risk of not being accepted a few years down the line. Even then, community college increases your chances of admission overall, so even if two years later the pool is somehow more competitive you’ll probably be accepted.

TLDR: Community college is *not* worth jumping the bridge over, arguably it’s better than the prestigious schools to start out with"

Question - 
Why is my CAS (Credential Assembly Service) GPA different from my UCSC GPA?

CAS created a standardized format to calculating GPA. For example, as noted above, a ""NP"" counts as a 0 for your CAS GPA. As well, an A+ is given a value of 4.3, whereas at UC Santa Cruz an A+ is 4.0. This your CAS GPA might be slightly different from your UCSC GPA."

I agree it is scored different...i.e. an A is worth 1 point × 4 hours is 4 points.  UCSC is on a 4 point system, so the most you could get in CAS is 1 point per A hour, not 1+."
kewc0l7,18q94cw,2023-12-25 11:55:15,"My guy.. it’s not the boogeyman, It’s not about believing. It literally states it on the LSAC website, UCSC website in career success, countless discussions about it online. Bottom of the line is YES, there is a distinction between an A and A+ when it comes to your CAS GPA.

kelpl61,18p3jcu,2023-12-23 05:10:26,if you get dropped it’s probably not too late. i’ve enrolled into classes 2 days before they started
ken33rm,18p3jcu,2023-12-23 10:33:37,"Yeah, you'll get auto dropped. If you could enroll in the failed course again for the upcoming quarter, that would be great. In the CS curriculum, I know that's asking for a lot with 90% of courses."
kenqn49,18p3jcu,2023-12-23 13:15:23,"You could email the faculty member teaching the course (for which you're scheduled to drop automatically) explaining your situation. And if you convince them that you'll do well in their class, they'll give you a permission code which you could use to bypass the prerequisite."
kenua18,18p3jcu,2023-12-23 13:40:48,That is exactly what happened to me as an undergrad.  The professor allowed me to take the class with a permission code as long as I retook the prereq the same quarter.
kenvwri,18p3jcu,2023-12-23 13:52:07,"If you’re retaking for the first time and the failed prerequisite class is available, go ahead and enroll. You should have your second phase enrollment until 01/07/24. Otherwise, yes! You’ll get dropped from your sequencing course in the Winter."

keha0d4,18oig5e,2023-12-22 08:17:36,"Yi Zuo is darling and brilliant. Also 126 was brutal, easily as hard as advanced cell bio. I think I crawled out of that class with an A curved all the way down into the mid 60s. There's a ton of developmental in there, though, so there's a good chance of some nice overlap between 126 and 128"
kel1a3b,18oig5e,2023-12-23 01:21:11,"Yi Zuo is nice and clearly enthusiastic about neuroscience but often very hard to understand through her accent unfortunately not to mention her lectures are dense. The class is definitely challenging but doable. From what I remember 126 was a lot of development of the nervous system and then the second half was about how neurons form connections roughly speaking. One journal club meeting where you present an assigned paper along with your group, everyone did well. some other small projects here and there but mostly easy assignments. Tests are pretty difficult so most of your work will be studying for those. She also insists you learn quite a few intricate signalling pathways which was probably my least favorite part of the course."

kefz3nd,18o98n7,2023-12-22 00:58:21,"I took ethical theory last quarter with Professor Dinishak and I had an amazing experience. For me personally, coming from a engineering background, the class makes you understand why people do what they do which was very eye-opening to me. As for the difficulty of the class, it’s extremely manageable and doesn’t take up much of your time. There are four large papers you have to turn in, three main ones and one for the final with smaller supplemental writing in between them. You are given more than enough time to do each one. and as long as you read and follow the instructions Word for Word, you will get full credit for them. 

Also, this class is an introduction class, so no prior philosophy experience is needed or expected, though it wouldn’t hurt to research well-known philosophers and understand their point of view and arguments so you will have a better time talking about them during the discussion section."

A+ an A are both translated to 4.0 for computing GPA, but that is the only time that the + does not change the numeric interpretation of the grade.

The grading standards that many high schools use (and that many students assume are universal, rigid standards) waste over half the points of any assessment on distinguishing the F students from the D students (both of which are essentially failing the class at UCSC)."

ke9lkq8,18n967e,2023-12-20 17:55:06,"Even though you got a D, you will still earn credits for what you got as long as you get above a D-. The only way you won't get credit for a class is if you get an F, I, W, or NP. 

Since you said you're going off old major requirements, I'm going to be basing off your plan on the 2020-2021 Neuro requirements. Seeing as you failed Biol 101 which is indeed a prerequisite for Biol 110, so you are fucked, plain and simple. The only other way you can possibly scrape by is to beg the professors teaching the classes you need during spring to let you in, but even then your chances of that succeeding are pretty low."
keeymsb,18n967e,2023-12-21 18:57:15,"Ok, so I was curious about your situation and did some digging. You COULD theoretically still graduate but you are severely hampered with possible choices in terms of upper div electives and what exit labs you could take.

Upper div wise you have:

* **Biol 128 (S)**
* **Bioe 131/131L (W)**
* **BME 110/130/160 (110 -FWS / 130 - F / 160 - WS)**
* Phys 180 (Although that has separate prereqs that I doubt you have fulfilled)
* Psych 121/131 (Same problem with above; has its own prereqs that I doubt you have finished)

Exit Lab wise you have:

* **Bioe 131L**
* Biol 103L (But you need Biol 102L and 102J which idk if you have it)
* **Biol 105L (S)**
* **Biol 121L (FW)**
* **Biol 186L (FWS)**

Bolded are the ones that you have the most realistic chances of getting into but thats also assuming you took 101L the same quarter and passed it. This is also assuming that you have already taken Biol 105 and passed, all your GEs are done, alongside you using the 2020-2021 catalog."
ke9eh52,18n967e,2023-12-20 17:05:59,"I think most if not all majors require C or better to fulfill the major requirements. I think you can get below a C and still get credit, but it doesn’t fulfill the major requirement. As for using a D to fulfill a prereq, I think you may need C or better, or try asking the instructor for permission to enroll in their class despite not passing the prereq.

Edit: I had success asking for permission to enroll in a class when I got a C- in the prereq. I wrote the professor an email explaining why I think I am ready to take their class and asking what prereq content is most important so I can brush up on that and prepare myself even more. You can also tell them you promise to go to discussions and tutoring. 

Idk how much of that info actually persuaded him to let me in the class but something I said worked."

keagp78,18n967e,2023-12-20 22:06:08,"You should talk to the prof for 129L and ask if you can take that class concurrently with 101 (let them know you need it to graduate that term), and if they are willing to give you a permission code then switch to the new catalog, otherwise you’re screwed unless 101 is offered in the summer which it usually isn’t."

kegahei,18nceus,2023-12-22 03:27:23,"Pretty cool class, just a lot of busy work for a GE but pretty fun. Class consists of bi-weekly discussion posts, a critical writing assignment like every other week (\~500 word each), and some game projects. There are no in person lectures, but the TA sections are mandatory so in practice it feels like an in person class.

You make your own game in Twine which counts for midterm, and then a game in Gdevelop with a partner which counts for your final. The TAs and graders are pretty chill, and will get back to you on discord fast, pretty chill vibe overall in the class."

ke0e0qi,18lugy5,2023-12-18 23:52:49,"I never go because of bad advertising. I realize there was a show like a few days after it happens. Also, after classes I kinda just want to go home."
ke1a1ms,18lugy5,2023-12-19 05:50:26,"I would go more often if I ever saw the announcements for them, but even being on the UCSC events mailing list and the UCSC Arts mailing list, I almost never hear about the plays.  I went to *Eurydice* this year, but that was the only one of the UCSC plays I heard about before it closed.  (Even *Eurydice* I heard about mainly from students at Cabrillo who went one week, so I went the next—if it had only run one weekend, I would have missed it too.)

I've no idea whether Rainbow Theater or the African-American Theater Arts Troupe had a show this fall, and I heard nothing of other student productions.  

There is a pretty big amateur theater community in Santa Cruz, but the UCSC theater students don't seem to connect with it (the Cabrillo students do a better job of that). How many UCSC students auditioned for the 8 tens at 8 festival, for example?

Santa Cruz is swimming in entertainment (mostly music, rather than theater), so it is hard to notice things that don't advertise through multiple channels."

I hear that family housing is highly competitive, given the nature of Santa Cruz's housing situation. From what I understand it is a random lottery of who gets in but I could be wrong. The website says that they only will allow service animals in, and ESAs on a 'case by case basis', as decided by the (I can't remember the name of the department, oof).   


I am in the same boat, my wife and I want housing there, but we have 3 animals. The 'case by case' basis makes it seem as though it would be difficult to get one, let alone two, ESAs certified. It is certainly worth a shot and reaching out to them directly though to see."
kdz84ti,18lnhbk,2023-12-18 17:53:28,"We had 2 ESA cats in Family Student Housing (FSH). My sense was UCSC Disability Resource Center (DRC) staff seemed to use it partly as a hoop for applicants to jump through to weed out the non-serious. DRC staff did call our mental health partner to confirm basic details.

Wait time for us between applying and move-in was somewhere between 6-12 months.

While we lived there, we observed a number of units empty for months at a time. It is possible turnover is delayed by staff/resource availability, remediation needed, etc.--none of which we have visibility to. 

Wishing you success."
kdz40rc,18lnhbk,2023-12-18 17:25:43,"I am a PhD student and I was offered a spot in the student family housing after 1 year (me, my husband, and a cat). For pets, you should look into getting your babies listed as emotional support animals. I think it’s currently the only way to have pets on campus. The DRC (disability resource center) is pretty easy to work with and UCSC seems pretty open to emotional support babies. Good luck!"

Check out financial aid estimators on the school websites. USC is not really regarded as Stanford though lol so if that's what youre looking for, maybe a higher-tier UC is your best bet. Remember that college education is an investment so think about what's best for your major, what'll get you the job/grad school placement, etc."

So unless you are a super genius or someone that already has a strong understanding of probability theory, this is a horrible idea. I also don’t think Draper will let you have a permission code for STAT 206, one of his conditions is that you get an A- or higher in STAT 131 or CSE 107."

kdvunl5,18kybdm,2023-12-18 04:42:32,This didnt happen??? I was there at the merrill dining hall? There was a soft serve machine but not a milkshake one.

kdt0pxb,18kqi31,2023-12-17 13:26:53,"Imo attending the lectures and sections will help you through the programming assignments. The midterms are just difficult so you can only do your best to study for them. Even then it's not that bad compared to some other classes like 103, in my experience. Never felt worried about failing 130."
kekne93,18kqi31,2023-12-22 23:03:16,Who did you take 130 with?
kekqnod,18kqi31,2023-12-22 23:35:58,"Veenstra, but I ended up going to a lot of Quinn's lectures"
kdt57dc,18kqi31,2023-12-17 13:54:59,The first time Quinn taught it was a clusterfuck but I’ve heard he’s made it easier over the few times he taught it now
kdsz3ey,18kqi31,2023-12-17 13:16:53,"It's not that bad, the midterm was more of a meme than it being super difficult. If u do all the things u said you'll be more than fine"
kdsxk03,18kqi31,2023-12-17 13:07:19,"Difficultly is subjective, but it is one of the harder classes. Even if the class was easy, would you study less? Just do your best. If you attend all lectures and start early you should  be fine."
kdtve3k,18kqi31,2023-12-17 16:52:02,you’ll be fine. it was hella rough at times but overall definitely manageable.
kdv7rsf,18kqi31,2023-12-17 23:59:37,"This would be an excellent start...
  
1. Build familiarity with C; specifically, regex, sockets, POSIX threads, and concurrency primitives. Understand the differences and relationship between send / receive and write / read.
  
2. Build familiarity with HTTP by reading RFC2616
  
3. Read the first section of the textbook that talks about modularity.
  
I think the true time sink of this course is poor design in the assignment. Students don't use regex and don't understand low-level socket details, so everything goes to shit when they start factoring in multithreading."
kdtw233,18kqi31,2023-12-17 16:56:59,"take it with Liting Hu, shes awesome, and the class didnt feel bad at all"
kduoxih,18kqi31,2023-12-17 20:35:24,"it's a tuff class, but if you attend sections, lectures and start early you'll be fine"
kdv57de,18kqi31,2023-12-17 23:27:29,"I took it with Harrison (don't know if he's still teaching it, graduated 2022). It was definitely tough but if you follow everything from the lecture material you should be good for midterms and finals."

keknp62,18kqi31,2023-12-22 23:06:16,Who was your prof in CSE 130?
kdvkw2k,18kqi31,2023-12-18 02:54:16,Only class I’ve ever failed in my academic history. It’s not that bad but if you are diligent
ke5s3lv,18kqi31,2023-12-20 01:35:38,"It's not that hard if you just want to pass but it's hard to get an A. The lecture isn't good enough to explain the concept and it's almost useless for asgn2 which is the hardest assignment. If you get to know how to use regex and handle string parsing in C before attending the course, you will be fine."
ke9g3o6,18kqi31,2023-12-20 17:17:21,Start the assignments early and go to lecture and it’s a medium to medium hard difficulty class. Not bad.

I graduated in 2017 and have switched jobs basically every 2 years for better pay and better perks. Leaving companies voluntarily for my own benefit. In every case, I’ve told my boss I will be *resigning* in 2 weeks. They’ve said, “Fine, just send me a *letter of resignation* with the details that I can forward to HR.” That’s just how professionals communicate with each other.

How else are we supposed to interpret your language here, other than the “walk don’t wait” video was a sign that a crash was inevitable?

I’m struggling to understand how it can possibly be interpreted as a sign of a “hostile work environment.”

To address your broader claim that TAPS *is* a “hostile work environment”, *is* run by “antagonistic bureaucrats”, and *is* characterized by a “long-standing history of unethical behavior”, I would say I need to see receipts. I saw the article you linked earlier; I understand the point being made there, and yeah, parts of it aren’t good. Supplying parts via eBay isn’t good. Buses breaking down isn’t good (even though it is very common for buses in all transit systems).

How else are we supposed to interpret your language here, other than the “walk don’t wait” video was a sign that a crash was inevitable?

To address your broader claim that TAPS *is* a “hostile work environment”, *is* run by “antagonistic bureaucrats”, and *is* characterized by a “long-standing history of unethical behavior”, I would say I need to see receipts. I saw the article you linked earlier; I understand the point being made there, and yeah, parts of it aren’t good. Supplying parts via eBay isn’t good.

Just a bunch of comments about how dumb it was.

As far as your second point.
>”Walk, dont wait”: A Crash was Inevitable

and
>Given the latest crash, I can only see it as inevitable, given the mindset of the taps.

How else are we supposed to interpret your language here, other than the “walk don’t wait” video was a sign that a crash was inevitable? That seems pretty cut and dry to me, and evidently most of the other commenters are having similar thoughts. I think an explanatory, clarifying edit to your post would probably help.

ke3kfva,18jqfxh,2023-12-19 14:21:36,"You have yet to show any evidence of bus driver firings. Assuming that a reporter means “they were fired” when they say “they resigned” is not evidence, it’s speculation at best. 

You reference the article, which mentions resignations last year, and now you’re saying the firings happened pre-covid? 

The bus driver shortage is happening all around the country, it’s a well known problem. They are begging for new drivers. It’s weird to assume, especially with zero evidence, that the shortage we have is unrelated to the nationwide bus driver shortage, and not instead an isolated UCSC conspiracy."
ke3ksus,18jqfxh,2023-12-19 14:23:50,Please actually read my post. And let's just say you are totally right. Resignation is never a euphemism for firing. That still doesn't mean it means quit.

YOU are the one who said “they definitely did” fire people, yet you’ve repeatedly shown that you based that purely on speculation that a single reported didn’t mean what they literally said, the burden of proof is on you. Just stop saying things with absolute certainty when you don’t have any reason to be absolutely certain about them.

Go ahead, read that again"

First, resignation is just a euphemism for firing. Always has been. If they retired, it would say retired. If they got better jobs, it would say quit or switch jobs—not resign.

kdqv8qp,18k5crq,2023-12-17 04:35:57,You can save a lot of money if you just take the 17 express to SJ then call a taxi (yes that's still a thing)
kdsmb0s,18k5crq,2023-12-17 11:59:00,You can Uber/Lyft from Diridon station also.

kdjk3xu,18j88jb,2023-12-15 15:49:30,Um yeah sorry. I left my water bottle there and completely forgot to take it with me. It’s the one inbetween the blue and silver bottles on the right. I will kindly take it back whenever possible <3 I really miss it and would be devastated if I could never hold it.
kdl7r6l,18j88jb,2023-12-16 00:54:37,Ahh unfortunately someone already claimed it and they seem really attached to it now. so sorry ❤️
kdny0h8,18j88jb,2023-12-16 12:58:18,That’s truly unfortunate. How will I ever get over this mistake. The two other water bottles I have at home will be disappointed that they won’t have a friend to hold water with ☹️

kdit9w7,18j2ibx,2023-12-15 13:10:24,"I’m sorry for all the people that have finals today. Truly unlucky especially if you’re planning on going home without a ride. Train and plane tickets get mad expensive the closer to the weekend/holidays and you’ll most likely also have the most traffic/delays. 

Salutes to all my brothers and sisters still in the trenches of finals 🫡"
kdj5927,18j5f4f,2023-12-15 14:17:40,Yes! But Pacific Shores has a bathroom for each bedroom so it’s mainly for the main living areas.

kdjt57m,18j5f4f,2023-12-15 16:54:28,It’s fair. They’re splitting the room but they also are using more communal space than a single.
kdmkedm,18j5f4f,2023-12-16 08:08:20,I have no idea how your brain came to that conclusion
kdn6uz8,18j5f4f,2023-12-16 10:21:41,Ok well when you rent a room you’re renting out the room and access to the communal areas. So more people per room equals more usage of those areas and therefore higher rent. Pretty standard
kdnh8ox,18j5f4f,2023-12-16 11:20:45,Sharing a room means less rent
kdp8mqz,18j5f4f,2023-12-16 18:06:35,"Yes, they’re still paying less rent vs having their own room.

The point is that you can’t put ten people in one room and split it ten ways because the stress on the communal areas is significant. 

There are equations people use for rent where rent is a function of both the private room and the shared areas. That’s why two people sharing one room adds up to more than one person alone in that room"

The point is that you can’t put ten people in one room and split it ten ways because the stress on the communal areas is significant.

Another option would be to buy a cheap non-electric bike and use that. You can put it in the front of a bus when you need to go uphill but then get downhill between your two classes quickly without worrying about if there's a BCycle available."
kdk019y,18ivu4c,2023-12-15 17:46:14,"Google maps bases their walking rates on a fairly slow ""average"" walker.  If you walk fast, you can cut 20–25% off their times.  They have some correction for elevation change, but it often seems to be less than the difference I see between uphill and downhill times.

I agree that getting a low-cost leg-powered bicycle is the way to go (just make sure it has low enough gears to get back up the hill)."

Honest to god though, her course was hard because you had to make sure you can tie all the concepts you are learning together. There were 5 projects and I found them to be not too bad as long as you go to section... In terms of preparedness for industry, Quinn/Veenstra's quarter long multithreaded http server project probably wins.

Either professor is cool though."

kdevzb3,18idcwb,2023-12-14 18:59:59,"Can confirm, truck driver. Busses equipped with air brakes use air to hold the brakes “open” in the event of a malfunction the lack of air will cause the brakes to engage until air returns."

If bus loses air to point that brakes won’t work, the spring in the brake chamber expands ( no longer held back by air) and the brakes get applied no matter how fast you are going. If bus starts losing air, before it’s too late and you get stopped …you get a warning .

kdeqbw1,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 18:20:08,knowing SQL is important in practically any line of the tech industry. most real life applications need to connect back to some backend database.
kdflzat,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 22:49:54,thank u!
kdfmd6l,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 22:54:23,just learn SQL on your own. The class is not worth it. The prof really went nuclear on this class by making it 90% exams
kdfmmg8,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 22:57:27,i heard 180 is one of the easier upper div electives tho?
kdfmv86,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 23:00:18,It was until the prof changed the syllabus this quarter. It honestly feels a lot harder cause of it. Additionally the test questions feel like they're set up to trick you instead of testing your actual SQL.
kdfr0gg,18ip4zv,2023-12-14 23:51:34,So did the exams become really hard and what's the best way to study for them now?
kdgdaf6,18ip4zv,2023-12-15 04:27:31,What’s the syllabus now?? What changes? When I took it was 10% gradiance 20% labs 30 midterm 40 final

kdbq3qo,18hud26,2023-12-14 06:43:40,Looks like the cause was the bus running into something.

kdjypf1,18hud26,2023-12-15 17:36:02,Oh good to know but at least there are bricks around the fireplace
kdc5r4n,18hud26,2023-12-14 08:24:31,Driving down from campus past the accident scene there were no skid marks. It appears the bus did not take the gradual curve and went straight into  the kiln. Operator error or mechanical failure? Either scenario is not good and at the end of the day I just hope everyone comes out of this okay!
kddfisw,18hud26,2023-12-14 13:03:50,"These pictures are heartbreaking, the poor bus driver! UCSC doesn’t pay bus drivers enough (or anyone for that matter), and they are always so friendly and kind. Freshman year (during Covid) I was sick and needed to get some cold meds late at night, so I called the safe ride number to get a ride to the base of campus so I could walk to the store. The bus lady was so nice when I told her where I was going and she just drove me to 7-11 and made sure I was safe going inside."
kd9c2ho,18hud26,2023-12-13 17:05:03,Those buses always scared me when I was a student there. I hope everybody made it out alive and will get to come home to their families.

kd9v9m4,18hud26,2023-12-13 19:19:47,They're 30 years old. Most PT buses retire after half that time.
kdcmusa,18hud26,2023-12-14 10:08:29,"The busses are expired. Use cases for these busses are 15 years max, but there have been in constant use for 3 decades"
kdapj6j,18hud26,2023-12-14 00:19:26,how it was caused is one thing the main important part is if everyone is okay. Hope to hear more updates!
kdc9p53,18hud26,2023-12-14 08:48:47,Those same busses have been running since the 90s and instead of replacing them with newer and safer ones the UC just buys cheap parts. I would 100% bet it was some mechanical malfunction and the school knows this and doesn’t want to maintain culpability. This is what happens when your university skimps on safety and accessibility. I really hope everyone fully recovers (and the UC better hope that too)
kdd537h,18hud26,2023-12-14 11:59:23,"I don’t think it’s responsible to make absolute claims like this when we really don’t know what happened. It easily could have been a medical emergency on the part of the driver (these things unfortunately happen). It could have been a mechanical failure, but we just don’t know yet. That doesn’t negate your points - that the old buses ought to be decommissioned and the UC has been negligent in that regard. Regardless of the cause of the accident, I think we all hope that the school now takes the safety measures it should have a long time ago. But claiming “I would 100% bet it was some mechanical malfunction…” is way too definitive given the amount of information available to the public. I won’t repeat rumors or hearsay but there’s enough anecdotal info floating around that does not align with this conclusion, so we should probably just wait and see."
kdctfzp,18hud26,2023-12-14 10:48:01,"So the Univer has been around and running buses for almost 60 years now, and there’s now been the first major accident I can recall it’s history. And there’s still no information as to whether it’s mechanical failure or driver error or perhaps a medical issue with the driver. But the summation is a definitive “ this is what happens when“?"
kde80wh,18hud26,2023-12-14 16:11:26,Unnecessary quotation marks are unnecessary.

kdd537h,18hud26,2023-12-14 11:59:23,"I don’t think it’s responsible to make absolute claims like this when we really don’t know what happened. It easily could have been a medical emergency on the part of the driver (these things unfortunately happen). It could have been a mechanical failure, but we just don’t know yet. That doesn’t negate your points - that the old buses ought to be decommissioned and the UC has been negligent in that regard. Regardless of the cause of the accident, I think we all hope that the school now takes the safety measures it should have a long time ago. But claiming “I would 100% bet it was some mechanical malfunction…” is way too definitive given the amount of information available to the public. I won’t repeat rumors or hearsay but there’s enough anecdotal info floating around that does not align with this conclusion, so we should probably just wait and see."

kdwm548,18i1w8v,2023-12-18 08:06:44,"Try raising the bed and nozzle temps over the filament’s specifications. Like 65-70c for bed and 218-225c for nozzle. Try lowering the extrusion height, and relieved the  bed. Try cleaning the bed with alcohol and remove all oils caused by hands. You can also lower the printing speed, set up a stronger base in the slicer using a brim feature. If the filament tends to stick to the side of the extruder when coming out, that can imply a fragment of some kind is stuck and requires some cleaning. You’ll probably want to watch a video on that."

“UC officials argued the raises are necessary because UC chancellors are underpaid compared with the leaders of similar institutions across the country.”

Maybe UC should step up and set an example. I’ll admit that I don’t know exactly what a chancellor’s job entails, but I am certain it is not worth $500k a year."

Is the whole system kinda crooked? Absolutely and has been for decades. Does that mean that paying a higher salary for chancellors directly causes worse educational outcomes and standard of living? Probably not. 

That has a lot more to do with California being an insanely expensive place to live in general, and educational standards dropping nationwide due to poor k-12 funding."

this article came out at the end of october, and my god it's insane. THEY'VE HAD BRAKE FAILURES ON THESE BUSES BEFORE! TAPS knows they're literally 15 years past the normal decommission date, and are buying replacement parts off of craigslist—the university caused this disaster with their own negligence, there's blood on admin's hands."

kd99020,18h8z19,2023-12-13 16:43:47,Tbh I was thinking it was something because bus drivers are trained to deal with break failure and if you look at the picture it seems they pulled a hard right turned directly into the barn. I can’t imagine that happening unless the driver had a medical emergency like a seizure.

kd99020,18h8z19,2023-12-13 16:43:47,Tbh I was thinking it was something because bus drivers are trained to deal with break failure and if you look at the picture it seems they pulled a hard right turned directly into the barn. I can’t imagine that happening unless the driver had a medical emergency like a seizure.
kd7o45k,18h8z19,2023-12-13 10:34:20,Where did you read about that?
kd7p8w1,18h8z19,2023-12-13 10:41:14,I didn't -- got it from a firefighter-medic buddy who was one of the first people on the scene.

""Ambulances are primarily used to transport people who are injured or who have been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness or condition. They will not be used to transport dead bodies unless there is a medical need for them.""

From what I've seen firsthand, the ambulance will arrive on scene as part of the response team, but, especially in smaller communities with less resources, will leave empty if the person is determined deceased on scene. They need to remain a resource for other emergencies, and once a person is declared dead, there is no longer an emergency. I've confirmed this with a paramedic friend after the incident I saw when I was confused why the ambulance left with the body still on the ground.

I don't really know the answer, but I would guess a hearse, or whatever the medical examiner brings. Although, I imagine, in a situation like this, it may not be out of the question that they'd bring a body away."

There are some async classes you could finish everything but the final and midterms in a day and others that you only get a week or two in advance unlocked on modules.

1) guided meditations + guided breathing. i know it’s kinda cheesy but i have noticed it helps ground me. even just sitting down with my eyes closed and focusing on breathing helps
2) sour candies/cold showers. anything to distract myself but also something to focus on. if something is super sour i tend to focus on that instead of overthinking.

in the end of the day tho, you are worth more than your grade. i am very proud of you stranger for just trying your best (and that’s all u can do & that’s okay!)"

On one hand, your final is done so he might not be there, but on the other hand, the quarter is still going and he might teach other classes so he might still be there? Hope everything works out for you."
kd2dfw6,18gq0a8,2023-12-12 09:57:40,Also make sure to show proof that you had another final at the same time so that way they are more willing to understand that

kd31cqv,18gq0a8,2023-12-12 12:24:18,"thats y I called you captain obvious. You do not need to state obvious things. Now you are doubling down by saying more obvious things, thereby promoting you to King Obvious"
kd4mbdq,18gq0a8,2023-12-12 18:42:35,"Email the professor ASAP, but to be frank, you might be fucked. You are at the mercy of the professor at this point. The “I had another final at that time” reasoning will likely not work unless they are VERY generous (this is something you should have known/talked to them about way in advance). Own up to it in your email (don’t suck up - most professors can tell when you’re BSing) and pray to the test gods. If it doesn’t work out, hey, you can always retake the class if you need to."
kdahxj3,18gq0a8,2023-12-13 22:45:26,"*Update* I emailed my prof and he understood my situation. Luckily because I realized my mistake quickly, he simply treated the Exam like a regular assignment and docked me 10% off my score for being a day late. I’m overall j grateful I was provided the opportunity to take the exam."

kd9wdbm,18h7jo8,2023-12-13 19:27:59,it’s just a lot of work and too many concepts in too short of a time for me. the final determines whether you pass the class or not so it has me stressing tf outtt. it’s a difficult class 😵‍💫

kd0d4vv,18gfvby,2023-12-11 23:06:45,"I had Tantalo for 4 classes. I needed a letter of recommendation and could honestly not think of a better person to write it.

I remember he responded back almost instantly to my email. He wrote me this long letter about how he doesn't write letters of recommendations to his students anymore because it takes too much of his time.

The whole time I was reading his letter I just kept thinking to myself ""Damn couldn't you just have wrote me the letter instead of this response?""

Good times."
kd0meaw,18gfvby,2023-12-12 01:06:35,"I asked him in person before and got the same response. Nonetheless, his class helped a lot of my friends and I get our jobs."
kd24htg,18gfvby,2023-12-12 09:03:04,"I love tantalo btw. 

But I’m guessing he had that letter pre written and sent to many students"
kd250om,18gfvby,2023-12-12 09:06:18,"lol no he actually regarded me and told me he knew who I was and I was a good student who probably did deserve the letter..

no hard feelings toward the professor, I just thought it was funny"
kd3xhy1,18gfvby,2023-12-12 15:47:27,He probably had a template and changed the first couple sentences.

kd0ntib,18gfvby,2023-12-12 01:26:28,What did this professor teach? I’m also curious to know what his respected acts of service were to so many students
kd2aosl,18gfvby,2023-12-12 09:40:53,"CSE 16, 101, 102, and 107. Most students in engineering will have taken one of his classes before."
kd33283,18gfvby,2023-12-12 12:34:50,in his programming classes he extends the due date for every assignment. in general also a pretty straightforward no bs class he’s made it fairly simple to succeed as long as you do the assignments
kd2gjvd,18gfvby,2023-12-12 10:16:48,I remember him making his class harder during the hight of Covid and when asked why he said he just felt like it. Not good times :(

kd52vuk,18h36gx,2023-12-12 20:44:33,"He's the best professor I've had so far. He explains concepts incredibly clearly and makes it a priority to limit the stress on students. I had a great experience in his cse 16 class from last year. With the way he structured the class/assignments, I found that discrete math is a lot like solving puzzles and connecting interesting concepts with each other. Every concept builds of the previous and with how well Arden teaches, it becomes much easier to learn new ideas."
kd5drbd,18h36gx,2023-12-12 22:29:50,"I took him for 16 last winter, and his class was really easy. The zybooks are a great resource and taught basically the entire class (they were required before lecture anyways, which made the lectures have less meaning). Every category was graded on median instead of mean."

kd5ft8l,18h5d0n,2023-12-12 22:53:08," I just got a similar situation resolved this morning. What you're going to want to do is attend one of the residence deputy drop in sessions. As of today (12/12), there's one tomorrow on Zoom at 3PM. You're going to want to be there as soon as it hits 3PM. They'll let you into the meeting, and will review your application right there and then. About 5 minutes after getting off the Zoom call, I got a notice saying that I had been confirmed a resident. I'll put the Zoom link below for the residence deputy, and please let me know if you have any other questions regarding this.

First-come basis, 10 students maximum capacity based on limited resources. Although the Zoom Meeting may appear “open” after these cutoff times, we will only be able to advise you if you entered the waiting room by the posted cutoff time and terms.  If time runs out, you may join the next drop in session.

Also if you have or can get a little lunch box or practice amp that would be fine for the dorms. You could also run your guitar into a headphone amp pedal then run that into a little speaker via aux/3.5mm."
kd3oues,18gq61o,2023-12-12 14:49:09,everyone plays in the dorms. as long as you aren’t playing after quiet hours no one cares
kd3yr8e,18gq61o,2023-12-12 15:56:06,i had an electric ~~guitar~~ bass in the dorms. i got by with some cheap studio headphones plugged in.
kd481h0,18gq61o,2023-12-12 17:01:49,"There's practice rooms available to anyone in the music center. Also no one cares or will do anything if you play in the dorms as long as you stop before quiet hours. You can also get a little headphone amp for pretty cheap or a lot of amps have a built in aux out for the same purpose. Depending on where you are there's also some lounges around canpus that you can by playing in like the C10 ""library"" that is just a small book collection and a grand piano. As long as you are respectful you almost definitely won't get in trouble. The only time I've ever been given any type of warning is when I was playing with some friends and a tour guide told us we probably should move some where else(we were playing outside so it was on us). I've had CRE's see me playing and not care so it's fine"

kczsnfr,18g66zq,2023-12-11 19:55:12,"Don’t take other people’s word for it, you already live in san jose, the only way to know how it’ll be with you car it to just take a few trips during different weather this month.

Main things you’ll miss out on are social stuff, study groups, clubs, and on-campus/in-town events. Instead of “it’s just downtown/on campus, I can check it out and leave if it’s not my vibe” it’ll be “is it reeeeally worth 1.5-2.5 hours of driving?”, which is especially prohibitive for just a 1-3 hr thing.

If you’re cool with *just attending classes*, or if you really want to or need to save the money, then def go for it, but from 1st hand experience, I lived in the east bay my first year going here and did absolutely nothing outside of classes, the next two years I lived in town and had the time of my life, met so many amazing people, and had so many amazing experiences on and off campus. It sucks to basically have to pay extra to be involved in campus life, but tbh it was worth every penny to me."

kd0eubu,18g66zq,2023-12-11 23:27:04,"Nah you’re good homie I was a transfer too and had nothing going on junior year aside from one club, but senior year (and an additional year) had a great social life.

Best advice is to join a few clubs/orgs/teams asap once you transfer. It took me a few quarters to really feel like I fit in with any group, so by the time I moved to SC (summer before senior year) it was perfect timing and I felt super comfortable with everybody I’d spent the first year getting to know. Ended up with a ton of friends and social circles, but you def gotta put in the work early to build them! 

I also recommend the random rec classes, they have several sports, sailing, kayaking, surfing, and other stuff that are great for meeting people with similar interests, and just having a few hours per week dedicated to something fun, scheduled self care ya know"

The problem is usually that the highway is a combo of 1) insane city drivers who want to drive a legitimately dangerous highway at 90 MPH and 2) ancient hippies from the county in some jalopy that won't climb hills any faster than 40

edit: also, as other users are saying in this thread, in severe weather (or graduation time) the highway can shut down and strand you. Most profs are pretty sympathetic to these rare cases (maybe like 1/year)."
kd0c1wc,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:54:05,"Well 17 is one of the sketchier major roads. I live in the Santa Cruz area and me and a bunch of family members commuted over it for decades. I did it for like 7 years. 

It’s definitely a road you have to pay attention on and if the weather is bad it can get shutdown by fallen trees, landslides, crashes.

During the week there shouldn’t be much traffic until you hit Santa Cruz. On the weekend there’s a lot of traffic because people in SJ commute to Santa Cruz for tourism.

Maybe try driving over to UCSC at 8 am and see how it goes before you decide."

It has two narrow lanes, fairly busy, on ramps with less than 200 feet to merge, areas to make left turns, extreme / wide bends that impede your line of sight. 
  
TBH speed limit should be reduced in some of these curves for that last reason. I've seen two accidents [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3orv75zDUBPgkAFT9) because traffic was at a standstill and someone couldn't slow down fast enough."

kczuuhw,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:11:40,Ooh that’s rough. For OP it probably comes down to where in SJ they’re coming from. 45 minutes sounds like probably Los Gatos-ish area so at least they wouldn’t hit a whole lot of Silicon Valley traffic.

Also, dude, living in Santa Cruz is still one of the highlights of my life. You will be short changing your college experience if you stay at home and just commute in for class. College is honestly about the experience of being out on your own, finding new friends, and enjoying some independence. 

If you absolutely need to do it for financial reasons you certainly can. But gas will also be pricey as will campus parking. And that 45 minutes gets real old when you are dealing with traffic. Not to mention it's 1.5 hours daily wasted from your life (and if you stay in SJ after college you'll likely be dealing with this in the work force)."

* have decreased stress and up to 10 hours a week additional study time, thus better grades

* be much more likely to attend campus events, thus get to socialize more

The commute on 17 has a much higher risk than most commutes and your safety is a real concern, especially if you have any late night or early morning classes where you are tired and driving in the dark through the mountains. https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/bay-area-highway-17-construction-18092448.php

If I didn't have responsibilities at home I would choose to stay on campus in a dorm, pay for a room in a house share, or get into van dwelling."
kcypdip,18g66zq,2023-12-11 15:25:01,"I would commute but try and bundle your classes to limit your trips. Tuesday/Thursday bundle or MWF bundle. 5 days a week would be draining. If you can bundle, then commute for sure. You would need a parking pass probably though, not too bad for R lot and would be a lot cheaper overall than renting. As someone else said, gas is not the only cost for a car, but probably will cost you the most. Basically, commute if you can bundle, if you cant bundle classes, it's going to be tiring but it'll probably end up cheaper still."
kcymwow,18g66zq,2023-12-11 15:08:25,"It costs a lot to live in Santa Cruz. If you get a single room with a meal plan, it would be around $2,200+ each month, without the meal plan (which would probably not work, there aren't a lot of food options near campus) it would be around $1,900+ each month. If you lived off campus, you might find something *slightly* cheaper but it would be more inconvenient. I would stay at home and commute if I were in your situation."
kcyuevs,18g66zq,2023-12-11 15:59:26,As someone commuting from even further who used to live in SC - just stay home and save your rent pennies. You’ll get used to the drive. SC is expensive and limiting in a lot of ways.
kcz159u,18g66zq,2023-12-11 16:46:07,What kind of events?
kcz7tn4,18g66zq,2023-12-11 17:31:54,"I commuted Aptos to San Jose for 3 years. Timing is everything. And sometimes you can get stuck in traffic due to an accident. To save the amount you will is worth it…assuming you have a reliable vehicle. 

You’re going reverse commute (if there is such a thing anymore). I would 100% commute, if I were you."
kczjxew,18g66zq,2023-12-11 18:53:32,Please don’t do that to yourself!! I worked in Capitola during my undergrad and just doing that was draining and took away so much of my valuable study and social time. Driving the 17 is even more draining than driving to capitola
kczr8on,18g66zq,2023-12-11 19:45:01,There’s a vanpool that goes to SJ that might be a good fit
kd032xc,18g66zq,2023-12-11 21:19:39,what’s that if you don’t mind me asking?
kczx0p2,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:28:15,"i commute and it’s really not that bad. i would definitely suggest trying to keep it to 2 days a week if you can and/or just avoid the instance where you are driving all the way down for a single one hour class on a friday for example, because that’s when it feels like it’s not worth it (speaking from experience). but considering you can save so much by not paying rent and how hard it is to find housing on SC, it’s a good option. 

yes the 17 gets wet, i’ve seen snow, and plenty of accidents but as long as you have a reliable vehicle, drive safely, and plan ahead you should be fine."
kczz88w,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:45:50,"I'm submitting my last paper ever for my degree on Wednesday, and I commuted from SJ regularly! It's definitely doable. However, I was a transfer student and took classes during both my summers here, started in summer term '22 and am finishing now in fall '23. Really condensed, and I was remote for maybe... four or five months during long Covid.

My recommendations:
- If you can put classes all on two days, do it. However, do not have it from 6am to 6pm for the love of god.
- If your car has bad gas mileage, and you have the opportunity to do so, look into getting a more efficient vehicle. I downsized to a sedan from a compact gas SUV when I got into UCSC, and it helped offset costs from the commute.
- Be extremely focused and plan out things in advance, course-wise. It sucks if you get bamboozled with a course that's only offered certain quarters and is at a stupid hour to drive to.
- Little treats made the commute more bearable for me. I always got a croissant and matcha from Verve after my morning class and it was nice.
- Pack lunch to save money, if you can, because it's a pain to get off campus and back if you have later classes.
- Apply for the parking permit as soon as you possibly can. Get a remote parking pass, and you can take the bus (loop and metro). Loop will take you around campus, as the name implies. Metro is the regular bus which is free to students who provide current student ID. Don't take the metro if you can afford to wait for a loop bus.
- I don't know how bad the bus is nowadays but I doubt it's improved much. Wear a good mask if you want to avoid getting sick, it's close quarters most of the time. The bus is usually late, so factor that into when you leave your house.

For me, it was a little harder because I can't climb uphill very easily due to my health, but if you're in better health than me, I think it'd make it a lot easier. If you are in similar health, uhhh... I sometimes had friends drive me up to social science hill and drive me back to my car. So that's an option! Overall it's kind of horrible navigating campus as someone with health issues.

Good luck on your educational journey, and I hope you find a solution that makes life easy for you!"
kd05nap,18g66zq,2023-12-11 21:44:24,"Doesn't seem worth it.  You could pick up a part time job in the time you spend commuting back and forth to school and you're going to be spending around $500 a month for gas, repairs, maintenance, parking, and insurance.

You could split a double with someone for \~$900. Not to mention you will be diminishing your overall education and college experience."
kd2dtv5,18g66zq,2023-12-12 09:59:59,Just plan on coming early and staying late. Then you get the benefits of campus but the rent savings. 17 is hard but maybe that’s your “you time” or something. I call my grandparents while driving 17 lol
kcympqa,18g66zq,2023-12-11 15:07:08,"Just know (and I’m pretty sure about this) that they don’t issue parking passes to freshman and sophomores, so it might be hard to get directly to your classes."
kcyoil7,18g66zq,2023-12-11 15:19:15,"I'm transferring in as a junior, will I be able to get a parking pass? If I were to get a parking pass is it guaranteed parking or a free for all?"
kcywhb3,18g66zq,2023-12-11 16:13:43,You’ll get a parking pass for the remote lots most likely you just have to fill out the appeal and state that you’re commuting
kczzoiw,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:49:32,"Juniors don't have that issue, AFAIK! I got my permits as a transferring junior easily."
kcyyows,18g66zq,2023-12-11 16:29:00,what about the bus?
kcz12ns,18g66zq,2023-12-11 16:45:36,It's definitely an option! But the only thing is the extended time it takes to get there and back would be inconvenient for me.
kczx8vs,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:30:02,"Half the fun of going to college is being with your peers. Whatever extra few hundred bucks you spend a month is worth it to be around the area where all your friends are. Yeah, you may be poor, but so is everyone else. Don't commute, you will be pissed."
kczl1zs,18g66zq,2023-12-11 19:01:25,"I commute 3 times a week and tbh its not that bad, it gets tiring after a while because of everything being so far. The road can close but its not usual, ive had probably 2 road closure in a year. You definitely save money on housing but it can wear down your tires and breaks"
kczoeid,18g66zq,2023-12-11 19:24:38,"Imo it'll be fine 80% of the time and 20% of the time you'll want to pull your hair out. If there's ever a crash on 17 your 45 minute commute turns into 2-3 hours. Personally I think if you can afford to live on campus, or at least in the county, do it. I used to do Hayward --> Cupertino commute, and that was manageable but I think 17 is a different level."
kcztlhd,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:02:24,"I commuted from Los Gatos back in 2011-2013. So I’d say it’s definitely doable and saved me a considerable amount of money. Especially during quarters where I could cram my schedule into 2 or 3 days a week. Not sure what Santa Cruz rent is like now, but I can’t imagine it’s gotten much cheaper. 

It did make getting involved with social activities or clubs on campus a lot harder. At the end of an 8 or 9 hour day with a ~1 hour commute still ahead of me, I generally just wanted to get home as quickly as possible. 
 
Hope that helps. Good luck"
kczugyc,18g66zq,2023-12-11 20:08:49,I’ll add: I’m currently working on a second bachelors and if I could’ve gone back to UCSC I would have in a heartbeat (and commuted over the hill all over again.) But I’m old and married so the lack of access to social activities on campus would be less of a downside for me now.
kd09rct,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:27:56,"I think either one would require a certain sacrifice. If you live on campus, or in the town of Santa Cruz, you’ll have to sacrifice the financial comfort of living with your parents. Saving money is a big thing and understandable though. If you do decide to commute from San Jose, you will possibly have to sacrifice a social life and time due to possibly having to sit in traffic depending on the times you leave SJ/SC. Also, the 17 isn’t the safest during the winter months. This could also mean sacrificing time from studying so it’s important to weigh your options. A good middle ground would possibly be renting at a place like Watsonville where rent is cheaper and the commute is about 30 minutes give or take. You could also possible have a social life if that is important"
kd09zw5,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:30:38,i know some fellow grad students vastly preferred living in san jose and commuting to living in SC.  quality of life so much better in an actual decent city.

kd1ybnd,18g66zq,2023-12-12 08:24:56,I'm finally going back to take the last class required for my degree. I'll be driving a 3 hour commute from Fresno twice a week to do it. Massively more affordable than moving to Santa Cruz.
kd36vla,18g66zq,2023-12-12 12:58:00,"I commuted my last two quarters at ucsc after the Covid from union city. I knew I would be saving money living at home and I didn’t wanna go through hassle of finding a place to live in SC. I drove a car that didn’t have great mpg either. At the end of the day, you gotta do what you gotta do. Driving he 17 isn’t bad as much as people complain. There is much worse roads out there. Just be smart with the classes you take and try to balance your time. If you are in San Jose, you are already beating all the traffic on 880 that happens during rush hour from people getting to work in the morning.
Good luck!"
kd3b941,18g66zq,2023-12-12 13:24:44,"I was a junior transfer last year, originally from SJ, and I lived on campus. Over winter break when the dorms closed I had to commute daily from SJ to SC for a job, and while the drive isn't terrible once or twice a week, it can get rather draining when doing it daily. I still live in SC and commute to SJ regularly to see family, but it's far more manageable during the week being able to access campus and provided resources, and not have to plan super far ahead for the commute. As others have been saying, commuting can be the best decision financially, as long as you're prepared for an hour long drive that can be fairly exhausting most of the time when doing it day in day out. If the social life in SC isn't really your thing either, I would say it is also a good option. Just remember to prioritize your mental health if you can, and figure out what that means to you."
kd427g0,18g66zq,2023-12-12 16:20:22,If you’re a transfer you can definitely live on campus for your first year to get the experience of on campus living. Housing for transfers is guaranteed for transfer students in the Porter b building
kd4qqem,18g66zq,2023-12-12 19:12:41,Probs suck to commute but high rent prices are a burden to many here. I recommend looking on FB for apartments outside campus for cheap rent (roommates of course). By cheap I mean splitting the rent with others. Being close to campus allows for more experiences on campus that you wouldn’t get if you were to commute back to San Jose.

The problem is usually that the highway is a combo of 1) insane city drivers who want to drive a legitimately dangerous highway at 90 MPH and 2) ancient hippies from the county in some jalopy that won't climb hills any faster than 40

edit: also, as other users are saying in this thread, in severe weather (or graduation time) the highway can shut down and strand you. Most profs are pretty sympathetic to these rare cases (maybe like 1/year)."
kd0c1wc,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:54:05,"Well 17 is one of the sketchier major roads. I live in the Santa Cruz area and me and a bunch of family members commuted over it for decades. I did it for like 7 years. 

It’s definitely a road you have to pay attention on and if the weather is bad it can get shutdown by fallen trees, landslides, crashes.

During the week there shouldn’t be much traffic until you hit Santa Cruz. On the weekend there’s a lot of traffic because people in SJ commute to Santa Cruz for tourism.

Maybe try driving over to UCSC at 8 am and see how it goes before you decide."

It has two narrow lanes, fairly busy, on ramps with less than 200 feet to merge, areas to make left turns, extreme / wide bends that impede your line of sight. 
  
TBH speed limit should be reduced in some of these curves for that last reason. I've seen two accidents [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3orv75zDUBPgkAFT9) because traffic was at a standstill and someone couldn't slow down fast enough."

kd0a4c4,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:32:01,"Highway 17 is pretty tough and has a history of fatal accidents, but if you're a good driver you can get used to it and it's no huge deal.

The problem is usually that the highway is a combo of 1) insane city drivers who want to drive a legitimately dangerous highway at 90 MPH and 2) ancient hippies from the county in some jalopy that won't climb hills any faster than 40

edit: also, as other users are saying in this thread, in severe weather (or graduation time) the highway can shut down and strand you. Most profs are pretty sympathetic to these rare cases (maybe like 1/year)."
kd0c1wc,18g66zq,2023-12-11 22:54:05,"Well 17 is one of the sketchier major roads. I live in the Santa Cruz area and me and a bunch of family members commuted over it for decades. I did it for like 7 years. 

It’s definitely a road you have to pay attention on and if the weather is bad it can get shutdown by fallen trees, landslides, crashes.

During the week there shouldn’t be much traffic until you hit Santa Cruz. On the weekend there’s a lot of traffic because people in SJ commute to Santa Cruz for tourism.

Maybe try driving over to UCSC at 8 am and see how it goes before you decide."
kd1psu1,18g66zq,2023-12-12 07:29:58,"I've been driving for more than a decade and commuted from SF to SC for three quarters. Hwy-17 looks bizarre because it predates modern cars.
  
It has two narrow lanes, fairly busy, on ramps with less than 200 feet to merge, areas to make left turns, extreme / wide bends that impede your line of sight. 
  
TBH speed limit should be reduced in some of these curves for that last reason. I've seen two accidents [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3orv75zDUBPgkAFT9) because traffic was at a standstill and someone couldn't slow down fast enough."

long answer: idk ur average credit per quarter pace, i think it has to stay above 12 to receive financial aid. no biggy if it dips below (my average has at times) all you do is work with financial aid a bit to create a SAP appeal (they can tell u more about it) and then financial aid applies to ur account. Def talk to financial aid!
Don’t beat yourself up over an incomplete, once you complete the coursework then it gets replaced on your transcript with the actual letter grade, good luck :)"

kcv5yq9,18fhv96,2023-12-10 20:49:00,Consider transferring after two years at a community college if you are concerned about cost and finding housing. Transfers also get priority for the first year and then you'll only have to find off-campus housing for your senior year.

kftipe1,18fhv96,2024-01-01 02:48:38,"Community College student here, I go to school for free. And others at CC’s get financial aid on top of classes being paid. Go to a CC first, it’s gives u time to get your GE’s out of the way, find out if you REALLY DO want to major in your major (most likely not, my friends and I all switched about 3 times before finally settling), maybe get some lower division courses out of the way; most importantly, learn what the college workload is like. High school is not the same as college. If you’re here asking questions on HOW to pay for college, this most likely means you’re missing some critical thinking skills, and effort to do your own research. 
Not everyone will give you everything served on a silver platter, I know it’s scary and intimating, because there is so much information out there, but part of growing up is learning how to navigate that on you own OR reach out to the school and speak with an advisor/counselor.
Being in college will teach you how to search for grants, scholarships, time management, balancing school & personal life, and what works best for you! CC is exactly like your typical 4-year university’s classwork wise, and socially, you’ll probably make even more friends of you’re doing GE courses  or a science series, and run into the same people. 
College is expensive, but there are ways to make it more affordable, you just gotta do your research buddy."
kcwxu9v,18fhv96,2023-12-11 07:52:39,"To be honest, the cost of a room pretty much everywhere else in California is the same. Even if you rent a room from the Central Valley you're going to pay $1000 a month, so if Santa Cruz is $1500 a month, that's an extra $6000 a year, in the grand scheme of things it really aint that much more...  


If you are struggling and poor then I highly recommend to do community college first. Save up your money for 2 years, then come to Santa Cruz or another UC and use loans, savings, and jobs to get through it.  


Getting pounded by 4 years of loan when you're already broke isn't really a good way to start off adulthood..."
kdc1gue,18fhv96,2023-12-14 07:57:41,I wouldn't say that's true. My mortgage for a 1B condo in Sacramento was about $1400. The Bay area is an outlier. There are a few other gentrified communities in SoCal that are similar but not on the same level.
kdc6jzf,18fhv96,2023-12-14 08:29:32,How much is rent in sac though? I doubt you’re able to get an apartment for anywhere under $1800
kd21squ,18fhv96,2023-12-12 08:46:36,"I pay $1300 + utilities for a single in an apartment with one other person. I'm in Santa Cruz proper but on the east side of the river which is a bit farther from UCSC and so a bit cheaper than housing on the west side. utilities and Internet come out to about $60-$100/month depending on how much we run the heater. Grocery bills have been going up, I used to pay about $50/week for food when I first moved year a year and a half ago, now it's like $75/week for food. I don't eat super cheap rice and beans type meals but I don't splurge on food either. I almost exclusively buy groceries and cook my own food, I very rarely eat out. 

I went to community college first, got a very specific degree that qualifies me for a job that pays $30+ an hour, and I work part time and go to school part time. But having that job also means I need to afford a car payment and gas to drive to San Jose and back 3x per week. I also picked up LSS tutoring this quarter to have some extra ""fun money"" because my other job and loan dispersements were really only covering my bills and essentials. I saved up a lot of money while in community college so I have a healthy savings account so I don't need to worry too hard about car repairs or vet bills for my cat, those I pay for with savings and then repay my savings account over time to get it back up to the amount I like to have. My mom is also available to help pay for things if I need it, she lets me use her Costco membership to get cheaper gas and pays for my cell phone and car insurance. She also co-signed my lease, so I didn't need to personally meet the income of 3x the rent requirement that most property management companies here have (but it also means she is on the hook for my rent if I ever don't pay it - which she would be willing to do anyway if something major came up and I needed to quit my job). 

It is expensive here, and doing CC first so I don't need to work full time at a minimum wage job but can instead work part time at a much more rewarding job was definitely the best decision for me personally. I also never lived on campus because by the time I transferred I knew I wanted my own bedroom because sleep is a challenge for me and I didn't want to deal with other people in my bedroom disturbing me when I was trying to sleep. I also wanted control over who my housemate(s) were (I only have 1 but I was willing to have a few if necessary) to make sure they'd be nice to my cat. Most people on campus are in triples, singles are apparently very limited. If you're willing to share a bedroom with 1-2 other people then housing can be much cheaper and living on campus can be a really convenient option."
kdunhfo,18fhv96,2023-12-17 20:23:19,"The housing is the worst part. You only get 2 years of guaranteed on campus housing. As a Junior, if you’re lucky you’ll get housing and as a senior, it’s very very slim chance. Most people start looking for off campus housing a year in advance because all the good stuff will be taken. You likely won’t see anything for less than $1,000 per month. In addition, if you receive financial aid, the University will give you less money if you live off campus because it’s technically “cheaper” (meaning that on campus is only for 9 months while off campus usually requires you to sign a lease for a year)"

Luckily it’s a very flexible job so I’m able to work a lot in the summer when I have time and work a little when I’m in school. It’s definitely not a typical job so I apologize for not giving you a typical answer. However buying and selling is a pretty good gig to get into! Even on a smaller scale with clothes and hard goods."
kcuzlyy,18fhv96,2023-12-10 19:55:21,"what if i dont have that, and i just get a regular minimum wage job, do you think its still worth it for me to go to ucsc or do you think I should just go to my state school/community college?"

You have to be ready to struggle when finding housing if you don’t go down the RA route but it is possible. I’ve heard of people making friends with seniors and swooping in after they graduate to get their housing. There’s also a resource on campus called slug support and they can help you financially if you can’t pay your rent one month or can’t eat for a night or week, though they are not to be confused with grants or scholarships. Slug support is there to give you a small boost if you need it. I wish you luck in your journey."

Also I will tell you that one time I almost skipped taking a final because I just didn't study. 

I told myself the only way in hell that I would pass was if my professor only put material from the first section on there. 

He literally put all material from the first 2 tests on there except for maybe 1 or 2 problems. So I ended up getting a C+ even with leaving those 2 problems completely blank."

kcvd0p7,18eyef9,2023-12-10 21:59:57,"I live in San Jose currently so that’s what I’m leaning towards, gonna try to find somewhere downtown"
kcu1n9r,18eyef9,2023-12-10 15:49:58,"You don't register an ESA as an ESA, you have your doctor or mental health care provider write a letter saying they have prescribed an ESA for you to treat a disorder that they have diagnosed you with. Anywhere that tries to get you to pay money to ""register"" your animal as an ESA is a scam. 

If you decide to go that route make sure to read up on CA laws regarding ESAs, so they don't try to charge you pet deposits, cleaning deposits, or extra rent for an ESA, all of those things are illegal. 

I also have gotten down voted by angry landlords for this, but do not disclose that you have an ESA until you have signed the lease. Your ESA is NOT a pet, if they ask if you have pets and your dog is an ESA, the answer is ""no I do not have any pets."" If you tell them you have an ESA, it's very easy for them to ""just so happen"" to chose to rent to someone else who doesn't have an ESA and you'd have no way to prove that they discriminated against you. Sign the lease, then say ""by the way I have an emotional support animal, here's a letter from my doctor,"" and it's really hard for them to discriminate against you then because they're already locked into a lease with you."
kcu1usj,18eyef9,2023-12-10 15:51:24,"Oh no yeah I’m very familiar with the process to get them registered, thank you for the renting tip though I wouldn’t even think to do that, it is fair though bc if they’re supposed to be impartial towards esa anyways it shouldn’t matter"
kcu1x1u,18eyef9,2023-12-10 15:51:49,If esa isn’t considered a pet does that mean that they would typically be excluded from pet rent?
kcuhat7,18eyef9,2023-12-10 17:39:46,"Yes, but my landlord that I have right now tried to charge me a ""cleaning fee"" for my ESA (which is illegal) and they insisted that it was very necessary and reasonable until I cited the California tenant's guide at them, which is an explanation of all the relevant laws of California regarding renting but in words normal people understand. It's a good thing to familiarize yourself with before trying to rent, especially somewhere where the power imbalance between landlord and tenant is as extreme as it is in Santa Cruz.

kcnd1pu,18e6lra,2023-12-09 08:30:52,"As people said courses are only a small part of the degree. Perhaps CS phd has one year of coursework but the research takes the rest of the time. Unfortunately unless ur work is directly aligned with ur phd research I doubt you will be able to do both at the same time. Phd is a full time job. It is a job not really school, you get payed to do research and work as a Teachers Assistant although the pay isn’t much it should be enough to let you only focus on the phd and not another job."
kcovwjb,18e6lra,2023-12-09 14:12:05,I work in education so maybe some type of research with AI and education? It’s an emerging topic and I’m already workshops that teach you how to use AI in education and then there’s of course the plagiarism for first time programmers. So they’re this constant pull from AI is good to AI is bad. Maybe that could work? How it impacts future CS graduates in the workplace. There’s a lot to explore here I think.
kcpwacd,18e6lra,2023-12-09 18:37:55,We do have an education department and a professor who is really into education and technology. I can’t remember exactly what his research is on right now but he does like to do a lot of research involving tech and Ed.
kcq1m8u,18e6lra,2023-12-09 19:22:00,That’s good to know. Thank you for all the insight.
kcm3k3o,18e6lra,2023-12-09 01:11:39,"I forget the credit requirement but usually you take at least a year of classes then devote all time to research. One year seems very optimistic to me. In my area, there was basically only two well respected conferences per year, and you use that work to build your thesis. I don't want to squash your enthusiasm, but my experience was negative overall."
kcn4fw8,18e6lra,2023-12-09 07:33:41,"For a PhD you gave different requirements that need to be met before you finish. Typically in the first year you take a preliminary exam that shows expertise in your area of study. Next, you have to pass a qualifying exam that is basically an explanation of your proposed research. Your research has to add something new to your field, unlike a Master's project which are often rehash of other work. Typically you take 10 units each quarter until you pass your qualifying exam to be considered full time.

After the qualifying exam, you are considered advanced to candidacy. This means your focus is now on research and most phd students don't take classes anymore. The last step to graduate would be you dissertation and defense. 

I would be surprised to hear of someone doing this in under 3 years unless they came into the program with their research mostly finished."
kcmvy2n,18e6lra,2023-12-09 06:32:54,I only know one phd who got their PhD in 2 years.  And that’s because their advisor was stabbed by a drifter and murdered.  This was in the 70’s.
kcpjbd3,18e6lra,2023-12-09 16:55:12,Call the admissions office and they'll find the right person for you to talk to
kcs9q8v,18e6lra,2023-12-10 09:03:55,Admissions office has little to do with the graduate program—department faculty make the decisions and set the curriculum.
kcsbmo1,18e6lra,2023-12-10 09:16:20,"According to the IRAPS internal dashboard, the CS PhD has a mean time to degree of 6.0 elapsed years and a median time to degree of 6.0 elapsed years (both 5.5 if you look at registered years).  There are only 1.7 or 1.8 years after advancement to candidacy, which tells me that CS PhD students are delaying their advancement way too late (either not starting on a thesis or delaying taking their advancement exam).

As others have said, a PhD program is intended to be full time.  It is possible to do a PhD as a part-time student, but that usually increases the time-to-degree, and often leads to students investing a lot of time and then not completing."

Only options of permanent avoidance is to never register car again, or sell the car (which just passes the problem onto someone else)"
kcjzyc4,18dwam4,2023-12-08 13:45:05,"There's no permanent avoidance. The owner of the license plate during the time in which the citation was issued will be sent a collection bill in which they'll have to (if they're the violator) own it and pay for it, or correct it by submitting an alibi that their car was being borrowed by someone (whom you'll be asked to identify if you contest it)."
kcmkik2,18dwam4,2023-12-09 04:54:24,He's correct. My car had 3 tickets on it and a registration hold. I sold it and was able to register a new vehicle and renew my license last month without a hitch.

I’m not saying you’re option isn’t real or available, but I am saying that there is in fact permanent avoidance. You could not register your car again, and then sell it whenever. Didn’t say it was legal, but it 100% works."

I went to a bar in San Diego and a cop decided to run license plates of the cars parked along the beach and towed mine when the tickets showed up. I couldn’t afford the $1600 to get my car out of impound and had to let it go, while the state garnished 25% of my wages at a coffee house. So, pay your ticket."

It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory. I'm aware of the personal struggles, but it's very few people who lead these wars and very few people who convince others that bloodshed is more important.

Israel is a settler colonialist project that caused the death and displacement of native Palestinians across the region. Zionism sees this as a good thing, as it is the firm belief that this land belongs to jews and jews alone. To be pro palestine is inherently to support their right to live in their homeland, which plainly goes against zionism’s belief that this land is solely for jewish people, and that they had a right to take it."
kcxs48g,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 11:57:38,"Zionism is the movement for self-determination of the Jewish people in their homeland. The existence of Israel is the manifestation of that right, which allows us to live as a free, sovereign nation in our homeland. Claiming that being anti-Zionist is not antisemitic would be like saying ""I'm not anti-Navajo, I just hate all Navajos who want tribal sovereignty and think its okay to use violence to dismantle the sovereignty that the Navajo already have""."
kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

Of course there are Palestinians who disagree but that is the only point of view that Palestinians have sincerely advocated on a large scale."
kcg6025,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 18:24:01,"tbh it seems like your coming from a good place but you are generalizing the entire Palestinian population as having one opinion. Also your statement ""Jews want to have their own state"" is misguided. A more correct interpretation would be ""Zionists want their own state where Palestinians do not have equal rights."" Like you are washing over soooo much injustice by oversimplifying it.

p.s. we as Jews are not a monolith. Don't lump us together as if we have one single view on this. Plenty of us are not religious extremists and disapprove of the Israeli government's actions. Plenty of us disapprove of genocide and apartheid."
kcg7aq9,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 18:33:29,"First of all, I'm not overgeneralizing. The overwhelmingly prevailing opinion in Palestinian society is that they want Israel to stop existing. The Palestinians who support two states for two peoples are a minority.

Israel is most respectful state in the Middle East toward its minority population. Arab-Israelis are significantly freer and wealthier on average than Arabs in pretty much all Arab states. They have the same legal rights as Israeli Jews. Israel being a Jewish state doesn't mean that non-Jews don't have the same legal rights, just like Ireland doesn't deprive non-Irish citizens of rights.

Almost all of us support our national sovereignty. There are outliers, but almost all of them are Western Jews who are part of far-left or even Marxist groups who have a whole host of ridiculous beliefs (ie Noam Chomsky)."
kch20y6,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 23:09:05,Lol dude. This so inaccurate. Like what are you even saying? The idea that Arab-Israelis who have wealth exist somehow negates the apartheid system is absurd. If I’d gone on my “birthright” trip I’d have had more freedom of movement than Palestinians who’s family have lived there for many generations. That is so fucked up and it’s just the tip of the iceberg
kch2aqy,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 23:12:29,"Arab-Israelis can move throughout the country as much as they want. The idea that they live under ""apartheid"" is completely made up. They vote in the same election and live under the same laws. Israel even has Arabs in major positions of power in both the government and private sector.

Also, Palestinians are not Arab-Israelis. They do not live in or identify with Israel. Their territory's legal status is radically different and has nothing to do with Arab-Israelis."
kch33g7,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 23:22:25,Whelp looks like you kinda unintentionally proved my point about the apartheid system by pointing out how ”Palestinians are not Arab-Israelis” and their “legal-status is radically different” in your reply. Goodnight
kch365v,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 23:23:24,That is like saying America practices apartheid because Mexican citizens don't have the same residency rights as American citizens. It's completely farcical.
kcpkq6u,18d3cl1,2023-12-09 17:06:15,Mexico has its own government… and America has very little say in what the Mexican government does whereas Israel controls almost all movement of items and people in Palestine. This isn’t even remotely the comparison you think it is.
kcpl5nr,18d3cl1,2023-12-09 17:09:37,"I'm not saying the current situation is okay, I'm saying that Arab-Israelis being legally different from Palestinians is the same as Mexican-Americans being legally different from Mexicans. The Palestinians have declined statehood many times, so thats why they don't have a state. Mexico, on the other hand, exists peacefully under the US.

Saying Palestinians should have the same legal rights as Israeli citizens because Israel maintains security control of some Palestinian areas would mean that West Berliners or Iraqis should have the same legal status as American citizens."

I have never said that all Palestinians are supporters of Hamas, I said the prevailing view in Palestinian society is that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Most Palestinians and pro-Palestine organizations have no problem saying this openly. They seek for an end to the Jewish state and its replacement with a Palestinian state from the river to the sea. Hamas supports that goal, but in a much more violent and theocratic fashion.

Noam Chomsky is a notorious whackjob when it comes to politics. He's a gifted linguist but should never be taken seriously on geopolitics. He has openly advocated for the Venezuelan government and is a socialist.

If you think my support of my people's soveriengty makes me a ""genocidal sociopath"", you are calling 95% of my ethnic group genocidal. Unless you think ALL peoples who advance their own ethnic groups political sovereignty are genocidal maniacs (including Native Americans, Kurds, Japanese people, Palestinians, and probably at least half the world), then you need to reconsider how you view Jewish people and how the media you view depicts us."

kcijuvt,18d3cl1,2023-12-08 08:09:18,"Israel does not represent us as Jewish people. Israel exists primarily because of support from the US, aiming to establish a colonial state in the Middle East. Israelis coined the phrase 'propaganda isn't a bad word' due to the lack of moral justification for their actions towards their neighbors. If the Gaza conflict targets Hamas, why does the bombing extend to the West Bank? This war fundamentally revolves around land.  
Moreover, you seem to use inflammatory language to portray your side as morally superior. How can you claim this moral high ground without any morals to speak of? It's undeniable that Israel's response greatly exceeds the events of October 7th, and Israel has been committing war crimes even before that date. They justify their actions using propaganda to sway individuals easily influenced.  
Supporting Israeli sovereignty means endorsing a settler colonial state that subjects Palestinians to inhumane and morally unjustifiable treatment.

kcke12o,18d3cl1,2023-12-08 15:22:59,"First of all, Israel does not exist because of support from the US. That's a completely ridiculous historical narrative. I'm not even sure what a ""colonial state"" would even mean in that context. Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

The links you have posted are blatantly antisemitic viewpoints which are thinly veiled by replacing the word ""Jews"" with ""Israel"". Neither Israel nor any Jewish institution is ""occupying the mind of America"". That's complete horseshit straight from the Protocols."

kcpq2eo,18d3cl1,2023-12-09 17:48:05,I read all of those reports when they came out and they're full of complete nonsense.
kct755v,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:33:48,"So are all independent ngo reports on Israel's violations of international law just bs to you? And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses. I believe in Israel's right to exist as a refuge and safe haven for jews but again it doesn't justify the settlements or the extreme restriction of movement on Palestinians daily lives. It wouldn't be ok if it was the opposite but a lot of people try to justify one's side actions."
kcufr32,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 17:28:33,"I think it's hilarious you classify HRW, Amnesty International, or the UN as ""independent"". They are all obviously political institution with no real independence. The directory of Amnesty even let it slip that his goal was the eliminate the Jewish state. I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory.

Zionism sees this as a good thing, as it is the firm belief that this land belongs to jews and jews alone. To be pro palestine is inherently to support their right to live in their homeland, which plainly goes against zionism’s belief that this land is solely for jewish people, and that they had a right to take it."
kcxs48g,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 11:57:38,"Zionism is the movement for self-determination of the Jewish people in their homeland. The existence of Israel is the manifestation of that right, which allows us to live as a free, sovereign nation in our homeland.

kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

Israel is most respectful state in the Middle East toward its minority population. Arab-Israelis are significantly freer and wealthier on average than Arabs in pretty much all Arab states. They have the same legal rights as Israeli Jews. Israel being a Jewish state doesn't mean that non-Jews don't have the same legal rights, just like Ireland doesn't deprive non-Irish citizens of rights.

Moreover, you seem to use inflammatory language to portray your side as morally superior. How can you claim this moral high ground without any morals to speak of? It's undeniable that Israel's response greatly exceeds the events of October 7th, and Israel has been committing war crimes even before that date. They justify their actions using propaganda to sway individuals easily influenced.  
Supporting Israeli sovereignty means endorsing a settler colonial state that subjects Palestinians to inhumane and morally unjustifiable treatment.

I'm not even sure what a ""colonial state"" would even mean in that context. Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

kcpq2eo,18d3cl1,2023-12-09 17:48:05,I read all of those reports when they came out and they're full of complete nonsense.
kct755v,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:33:48,"So are all independent ngo reports on Israel's violations of international law just bs to you? And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses. I believe in Israel's right to exist as a refuge and safe haven for jews but again it doesn't justify the settlements or the extreme restriction of movement on Palestinians daily lives. It wouldn't be ok if it was the opposite but a lot of people try to justify one's side actions."
kcufr32,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 17:28:33,"I think it's hilarious you classify HRW, Amnesty International, or the UN as ""independent"". They are all obviously political institution with no real independence. The directory of Amnesty even let it slip that his goal was the eliminate the Jewish state. I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

You have the freedom to speech - everyone does. But this conversation is not about speech, but about morality.

It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory.

kct7mxe,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:36:45,"I don’t think you’re using the term zionism correctly. Israel is a settler colonialist project that caused the death and displacement of native Palestinians across the region. Zionism sees this as a good thing, as it is the firm belief that this land belongs to jews and jews alone. To be pro palestine is inherently to support their right to live in their homeland, which plainly goes against zionism’s belief that this land is solely for jewish people, and that they had a right to take it."
kcxs48g,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 11:57:38,"Zionism is the movement for self-determination of the Jewish people in their homeland. The existence of Israel is the manifestation of that right, which allows us to live as a free, sovereign nation in our homeland. Claiming that being anti-Zionist is not antisemitic would be like saying ""I'm not anti-Navajo, I just hate all Navajos who want tribal sovereignty and think its okay to use violence to dismantle the sovereignty that the Navajo already have""."
kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

kcg7aq9,18d3cl1,2023-12-07 18:33:29,"First of all, I'm not overgeneralizing. The overwhelmingly prevailing opinion in Palestinian society is that they want Israel to stop existing. The Palestinians who support two states for two peoples are a minority.

Israel is most respectful state in the Middle East toward its minority population. Arab-Israelis are significantly freer and wealthier on average than Arabs in pretty much all Arab states. They have the same legal rights as Israeli Jews. Israel being a Jewish state doesn't mean that non-Jews don't have the same legal rights, just like Ireland doesn't deprive non-Irish citizens of rights.

Almost all of us support our national sovereignty. There are outliers, but almost all of them are Western Jews who are part of far-left or even Marxist groups who have a whole host of ridiculous beliefs (ie Noam Chomsky)."

The Palestinians have declined statehood many times, so thats why they don't have a state. Mexico, on the other hand, exists peacefully under the US.

Saying Palestinians should have the same legal rights as Israeli citizens because Israel maintains security control of some Palestinian areas would mean that West Berliners or Iraqis should have the same legal status as American citizens."

I have never said that all Palestinians are supporters of Hamas, I said the prevailing view in Palestinian society is that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Most Palestinians and pro-Palestine organizations have no problem saying this openly. They seek for an end to the Jewish state and its replacement with a Palestinian state from the river to the sea. Hamas supports that goal, but in a much more violent and theocratic fashion.

Noam Chomsky is a notorious whackjob when it comes to politics. He's a gifted linguist but should never be taken seriously on geopolitics. He has openly advocated for the Venezuelan government and is a socialist.

Israelis coined the phrase 'propaganda isn't a bad word' due to the lack of moral justification for their actions towards their neighbors. If the Gaza conflict targets Hamas, why does the bombing extend to the West Bank? This war fundamentally revolves around land.  
Moreover, you seem to use inflammatory language to portray your side as morally superior. How can you claim this moral high ground without any morals to speak of? It's undeniable that Israel's response greatly exceeds the events of October 7th, and Israel has been committing war crimes even before that date. They justify their actions using propaganda to sway individuals easily influenced.  
Supporting Israeli sovereignty means endorsing a settler colonial state that subjects Palestinians to inhumane and morally unjustifiable treatment.

kcke12o,18d3cl1,2023-12-08 15:22:59,"First of all, Israel does not exist because of support from the US. That's a completely ridiculous historical narrative. I'm not even sure what a ""colonial state"" would even mean in that context. Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

kct755v,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:33:48,"So are all independent ngo reports on Israel's violations of international law just bs to you? And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses. I believe in Israel's right to exist as a refuge and safe haven for jews but again it doesn't justify the settlements or the extreme restriction of movement on Palestinians daily lives. It wouldn't be ok if it was the opposite but a lot of people try to justify one's side actions."
kcufr32,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 17:28:33,"I think it's hilarious you classify HRW, Amnesty International, or the UN as ""independent"". They are all obviously political institution with no real independence. The directory of Amnesty even let it slip that his goal was the eliminate the Jewish state. I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

His endgame was to try to pressure Israel to accept an immense number of Arab ""refugees"" (who had mostly never set foot in Israel) to alter Israel's demographics and use that as a means of turning Israel into an Arab state. This is why he violently refused Israel's offer of statehood and refused to provide a counteroffer.

It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory. I'm aware of the personal struggles, but it's very few people who lead these wars and very few people who convince others that bloodshed is more important.

Zionism sees this as a good thing, as it is the firm belief that this land belongs to jews and jews alone. To be pro palestine is inherently to support their right to live in their homeland, which plainly goes against zionism’s belief that this land is solely for jewish people, and that they had a right to take it."

kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

Israel is most respectful state in the Middle East toward its minority population. Arab-Israelis are significantly freer and wealthier on average than Arabs in pretty much all Arab states. They have the same legal rights as Israeli Jews. Israel being a Jewish state doesn't mean that non-Jews don't have the same legal rights, just like Ireland doesn't deprive non-Irish citizens of rights.

Almost all of us support our national sovereignty. There are outliers, but almost all of them are Western Jews who are part of far-left or even Marxist groups who have a whole host of ridiculous beliefs (ie Noam Chomsky)."

I have never said that all Palestinians are supporters of Hamas, I said the prevailing view in Palestinian society is that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Most Palestinians and pro-Palestine organizations have no problem saying this openly. They seek for an end to the Jewish state and its replacement with a Palestinian state from the river to the sea. Hamas supports that goal, but in a much more violent and theocratic fashion.

Noam Chomsky is a notorious whackjob when it comes to politics. He's a gifted linguist but should never be taken seriously on geopolitics. He has openly advocated for the Venezuelan government and is a socialist.

If the Gaza conflict targets Hamas, why does the bombing extend to the West Bank? This war fundamentally revolves around land.  
Moreover, you seem to use inflammatory language to portray your side as morally superior. How can you claim this moral high ground without any morals to speak of? It's undeniable that Israel's response greatly exceeds the events of October 7th, and Israel has been committing war crimes even before that date. They justify their actions using propaganda to sway individuals easily influenced.  
Supporting Israeli sovereignty means endorsing a settler colonial state that subjects Palestinians to inhumane and morally unjustifiable treatment.

I'm not even sure what a ""colonial state"" would even mean in that context. Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses. I believe in Israel's right to exist as a refuge and safe haven for jews but again it doesn't justify the settlements or the extreme restriction of movement on Palestinians daily lives.

kcufr32,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 17:28:33,"I think it's hilarious you classify HRW, Amnesty International, or the UN as ""independent"". They are all obviously political institution with no real independence. The directory of Amnesty even let it slip that his goal was the eliminate the Jewish state. I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory.

kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

The links you have posted are blatantly antisemitic viewpoints which are thinly veiled by replacing the word ""Jews"" with ""Israel"". Neither Israel nor any Jewish institution is ""occupying the mind of America"". That's complete horseshit straight from the Protocols."

kct755v,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:33:48,"So are all independent ngo reports on Israel's violations of international law just bs to you? And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses. I believe in Israel's right to exist as a refuge and safe haven for jews but again it doesn't justify the settlements or the extreme restriction of movement on Palestinians daily lives. It wouldn't be ok if it was the opposite but a lot of people try to justify one's side actions."
kcufr32,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 17:28:33,"I think it's hilarious you classify HRW, Amnesty International, or the UN as ""independent"". They are all obviously political institution with no real independence. The directory of Amnesty even let it slip that his goal was the eliminate the Jewish state. I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory. I'm aware of the personal struggles, but it's very few people who lead these wars and very few people who convince others that bloodshed is more important.

kd09eoh,18d3cl1,2023-12-11 22:24:01,"That's just not what Zionism is, and your metaphor couldn't be more off. Zionism is the belief that Judaism is should be both a religion and nationality within Palestine or what some refer to as ""Greater Israel"". It sees this land as SOLELY jewish, and strictly follows the belief that this is the land of Jewish People and no one else. You're operating on the assumption that ONLY so-called jewish people are native to Palestine, when history tells us something very different. In basic terms, zionism sees religion and nationality as the same. Zionism actively believes that no one should control said land but jews, and operates on the idea that Palestinians (of all religions) have no right to the homes they were very recently thrown out of (The Nakba, Settlements, etcetera). Zionism is not solely the idea that modern Jewish people deserve self determination in a land they've never lived in solely because of their religion and religious culture, it believes that they should have determination over EVERYONE that lives there. This is exactly why zionists murdered Count Bernadotte of the UN's team when he was set to recommend that territorial renegotiations be had with the native Palestinian people who had been forced from their homes following the 1947 Plan. 

Zionism is not the belief that Jewish people should have the right to a voice or the right to self-determination, it's the idea that they should have supreme control over a land that a sub-sect of their religion believes is their religious holy land. As for your metaphor, I think it's fruitless to try to compare the push for Zionism as anything close to the rights of Native people to self-determination on land that had no connection to their tribal communities, solely as a way to ground themselves and push back against the literal government that caused FAR more atrocities against them. That is more a ""take and save what we can"" mentality, not a right to return one. The Palestinian people never colonized land away from Jewish people worldwide. They just happened to live in a place where thousands of years ago governments that haven't existed for centuries were biased against Jewish people. Want to talk about reparations? Be my guest. Forcing people out of their homes and creating a religious ethno-state is not the way to repair harm, and that's exactly what Zionism stands for."

I have never said that all Palestinians are supporters of Hamas, I said the prevailing view in Palestinian society is that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Most Palestinians and pro-Palestine organizations have no problem saying this openly. They seek for an end to the Jewish state and its replacement with a Palestinian state from the river to the sea. Hamas supports that goal, but in a much more violent and theocratic fashion.

Noam Chomsky is a notorious whackjob when it comes to politics. He's a gifted linguist but should never be taken seriously on geopolitics. He has openly advocated for the Venezuelan government and is a socialist.

Moreover, you seem to use inflammatory language to portray your side as morally superior. How can you claim this moral high ground without any morals to speak of? It's undeniable that Israel's response greatly exceeds the events of October 7th, and Israel has been committing war crimes even before that date. They justify their actions using propaganda to sway individuals easily influenced.  
Supporting Israeli sovereignty means endorsing a settler colonial state that subjects Palestinians to inhumane and morally unjustifiable treatment.

It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory. I'm aware of the personal struggles, but it's very few people who lead these wars and very few people who convince others that bloodshed is more important.

kcnx8hu,18d3cl1,2023-12-09 10:37:03,"Regardless of the name, title or past, the present is more important. Even if israel commits acts of genocide, Palestine has done the same. No one is above the act's of violence. Is it not time to just unite against the common enemies instead of fighting another brother or sister? It may have been Palestine but fighting yesterday's battles do not change the fact that those battles are lost and many more are still happening. 

It's true. Israel does not treat most Palestinians well. Apartheid still happens there. But before there can be peace, the world needs to see change from both sides before any change will happen. Radical behaviors needs to stop. Despite several countries being responsible for it's current state, remember not everyone is a Zionist, or a Hamas supporter. Very few actually lead those groups. 

Is it not time to let go, Palestine is equivalently lost to time itself. How can you ever find peace with a world who no longer recognizes Palestine, in a world that sees people in the middle east as just one people, third world countries, Palestine is although a dream now, is a distant memory. I'm aware of the personal struggles, but it's very few people who lead these wars and very few people who convince others that bloodshed is more important.

I'm not even sure what a ""colonial state"" would even mean in that context. Every Middle Eastern state is based on a particular ethnic or religious establishment, and in pretty much every Middle Eastern state the dominant group is immensely more oppressive to its minorities than Israel has ever been. Hell, I can't even think of another Middle Eastern state that grants its MAJORITY group effective basic rights. Look at what goes on in Egypt or Saudi or Syria.

The reason that the bombing has extended to (incredibly limited) areas of the West Bank is that the same terror groups Israel is fighting in Gaza or their allied terror orgs have military gained control of those areas in the West Bank. It's the same reason the Allies bombed parts of France that were occupied by the Nazis.

Israeli soldiers have not engaged in a door-to-door massacre of Gazans nor a mass shooting of a music festival in Gaza. Anyone telling you that is lying. All of the Palestinian deaths have been as a result of the conflict that Hamas started willingly on October 7th when they invaded Israel for the sole purpose of intentionally murdering civilians.

The links you have posted are blatantly antisemitic viewpoints which are thinly veiled by replacing the word ""Jews"" with ""Israel"". Neither Israel nor any Jewish institution is ""occupying the mind of America"". That's complete horseshit straight from the Protocols."

When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba?

I also cannot take them even remotely seriously after reading that report. A mixture of false claims, out of context historical events, egregious double standards, statistical misrepresentation (ie playing with numbers to try and reinforce a predetermined narrative), and just straight up inventing international law that doesn't exist. I can see how their report would be very convincing if the reader had no prior knowledge on Israel or international law, but I can't see how any knowledgable person could call it ""independent"".

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

Jews have never claimed a ""right to displace Palestinians"". Thats just ethnic propaganda. The right we claim is the right to establish a Jewish community in our ancestral homeland and claim sovereignty over it. Starting in the 1880s, when ""Palestine"" was a rough geographic region split up between several Ottoman provinces with no distinct national identity yet being asserted by its inhabitants, let alone one based on borders that hadn't yet existed, Jews purchased land and built up areas in the region. During the period of Zionist settlement, the Arab population increased drastically and became far better off. Even though the Arab population later started to oppose Zionism because they developed their own ethnonational movement, you cannot claim that Zionist settlement ""displaced"" the Arabs during this time period because the net effect of this settlement was a massive increase in Arab population and even the establishment of many new Arab settlements.

Many Jews were actually displaced as a result of Arab violence, for example in Hebron. The only reason Palestinians later became displaced was their decision to launch an all our war against the Jews in 1948 that the Jewish leadership tried to avoid desparately. As a result of that war, mass displacement occured on both sides. 80% of the Arabs in what became Israel were displaced, 100% of the Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were displaced or killed, and ~97% of the Jews living in other Arab countries were forced out due to antisemitic violence. Of course all of this is tragic, but to call it both premeditated and solely the responsibility of the Jews is both morally and historically dishonest. If every single population who was forced from their home as a result of war in that time period was allowed to use that as justification for war, the world would collapse. After all, there were many far larger and far more bloody mass displacements going on in 1948 than the one the Palestinians faced.

If the Cherokee managed to reconstitute their nation over a defined territory, I would support their right to self-determination over that territory. Tribal sovereignty is currently the mechanism by which that is done in the US."

It doesn't make anti-trans violence any less abhorrent to say that it fits the definition of hate crime rather than genocide.

  
Diagnosing someone as a psychopath after a brief interaction with them over the internet where they disagreed with you is, by the way, not a good look."

kct755v,18d3cl1,2023-12-10 12:33:48,"So are all independent ngo reports on Israel's violations of international law just bs to you? And also by your logic about Jews returning to their homeland, they have been seperated from for about 2000, years make it ok to just go back and displaced the people that inhabited the land after the roman exile? When you said that the people living there were just under ottoman rule and it was just ottoman provinces, I guess by that logic the Egyptians were never Egyptians after the fall of Cleopotra since every empire in Egypt after were just provinces of other empires like Rome and the various Muslim caliphates. By your logic, you would be ok with the Cherokee who are currently in Oklahoma to go back to the south and displace most of the white people and black people living there and form their new state. I understand how important it was for jews to be able to return to zion especially after the holocaust but it still doesn't justify the displacement of Palestinians, and the displacement of Palestinians doesn't justify terrorist actions on Israelis as well. And since Israel has right of return for all jews around the world, should Palestinians have right of return after the Nakba? There are still people who are alive from the Nakba and still have keys to their old houses.

None of the work will feel like busy work but the homework does take a bit of time. Exams were a bit hard but study guides are provided to help. Lectures may feel a bit slow at times but i found them to be key to succeed in the class as just reading the textbook wasnt enough. But overall i felt as though taking this class was worth it from what i learned. 
From what colleagues have told me about cse100, the labs are what is really draining due to their time consuming nature and each lab builds upon the next so you really need to get each one right.

kcfhuke,18d84jf,2023-12-07 15:29:52,"I’m not disabled, but have helped students navigate campus. For a physically disabled student, UCSC is the least friendly of the UCs, almost entirely because of the landscape. It’s in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. UCSC definitely tries but it’s hilly with tons of tree roots and levels. If you have a car with a placard, it’s significantly easier as most buildings have disabled parking close by. But otherwise it’s going to take a lot of time to go anywhere. Most students find it a challenge to get from class to class within the 15 minute break."
kcfj8ji,18d84jf,2023-12-07 15:39:39,do they allow electric bikes on campus and if so do you think that would work getting from class to class? I can ride them for short distances but i know some campuses banned them
kcflinh,18d84jf,2023-12-07 15:55:49,Yes! E-bikes are essential with the hills.
kcfo60k,18d84jf,2023-12-07 16:14:48,Thank you!!
kcg03xq,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:41:39,"The DRC at UCSC is super helpful. I can’t speak for whatever department you plan to join, but I forum no problem moving in with my ESA. We did have to share a room, but my roommates were awesome. There are 24 hour libraries/writing centers, lots of variety at the different dining halls, and plenty of clubs and activities to join. 

They have a program for DRC students that digitizes all your textbooks if you want, so you can listen to them as audiobooks. There’s math tutoring. There’s the potential to request accommodations for more time on tests and assignments. You might qualify for short breaks during exams. 

And there is a vanpool you can call for mobility issues and rides to your campus if you are physically disabled. We had a man in a wheelchair in our year, and he said they were super accommodating. 

I will say if you are physically disabled it will be hard to access some of the best parts of campus life, hiking in the old growth preserve. I got published for some photography I did back there. It was awesome. 

I found no resistance to the accommodations I requested, but again that’s professor and department dependent. 

Finally, there is a reputation for research being highly accessible for undergraduates (if you keep up in your studies and make an effort in office hours). 

All in all, despite it being an extremely expensive place to live, the busses around town allow students to venture out and make it back to campus easily. There’s loads of support for mental health. The outdoors really provide space for exercise and meditation and adventure. You can even take up surfing if you’ve never tried it. There’s also sailing classes for free down at the harbor. 

Ps. Our nickname is UC Sexy Calves. Even if you bike, which is super fun around campus and down to the beach, be prepared for lots of time outdoors and a challenging course load you must balance with your mental health. 

UCSC is a top university in science reasearch and publishing. Make sure you get organized and disciplined and prepare to work. Your degree will take you far."

kcg2o58,18d84jf,2023-12-07 18:00:20,"Sure! You have to make sure they are all up to date on their vaccines. I would contact the DRC in advance to connect you with their most recent requirements.

kcg751q,18d84jf,2023-12-07 18:32:18,"I would just ask your doctor to write it. They usually have experience with these things.

There was not much to judge in my letter is the point. Doctors know about confidentiality. 

It should say something like: 

“To whom it may concern,

I am writing to inform you that my patient [your name] has been in my care since [date] and I have evaluated their mental health. Due to their particular needs, I have prescribed an emotional support animal to help them cope with their disability. He/She meets the definitions of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Rehabilitation act of 1973, and they is entitled to retain their emotional support animal wherever they live in California.

. . .” 

They can say more about how to contact them and their practice to establish their credentials. 

It doesn’t need to say the stuff about the Rehabilitation act, especially if they’re not familiar with those policies. 

You can always google ESA letters and bring examples into your doctor if they need some reference.

kcfup4v,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:02:12,"Context: I'm a disabled student, who uses a cane to get around everywhere  


UCSC is not disabled friendly. Our campus buses, housing, and classrooms are not accessible at all. When I came to UCSC I never imagined I would need an accessible space, but now that I do, I regret coming to UCSC. What UCSC does to for disabled people is the bare minimum, often only doing things so that they don't get sued.   


Yes we have a disability van service, but only because our campus buses are so old they're exempted from the ADA (buses maintained by the university so we don't have to comply with the ADA). Our campus environment routinely includes sharp hills, small pathways, and dirt walk ways. It is literally easier to walk on the roads in some places, then it is to take the paths since they make the roads flat but the paths not.   


As for accommodations, the DRC at our school is overwhelmed and unable to manage or help most disabled students. Students have had to form a DSU (Disability Student Union) in order to get the DRC to fix or even address some of the basic problems on campus. I have routinely had professors deny accommodations or provide lack luster attempts to meet them.   


If accessibility is your main concern when choosing a school, don't come to UCSC"
kcg08eg,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:42:34,"ah dangit, thank you for letting me know! this was my dream school, idk why people cant just treat disabled people fairly"
kcj59qh,18d84jf,2023-12-08 10:25:59,"To be very clear - a lot of the issues stem specifically from the fact that the school is built into a hill side, with ravines, elevation, and nature preserved. 

So some of the charm is unfortunately exactly what makes it tough. And the campus transit systems as mentioned are largely designed to travel a main circuit around the campus, but doesnt' inherently help you get up/down some of the main hills. There are supplementary shuttles and the van as mentioned, but the core reality is the landscape makes it pretty challenging. 

It can be done but be prepared to be a bit frustrated at times. And frankly you'd likely want to not stack classes back to back as it can take even able bodied people 15-25 minutes sometimes to get cross campus. Let alone someone needed to take more time to stay stable/safe."
kciddyx,18d84jf,2023-12-08 07:26:45,They are being treated fairly. What you want is special treatment.
kcg7ic0,18d84jf,2023-12-07 18:35:02,absolutely not lol not disabled friendly
kcfpr47,18d84jf,2023-12-07 16:26:12,"I have heard of people who get a DRC accomodation letter for a single and still get placed in a double/triple/quad because there's no available singles. If that's something that would be a need of yours then I would reconsider. If your only housing accomodation you would need is an ESA, then I have not heard of people having any problems with those, as long as your ESA will get along well with roommates and you clean up after your ESA appropriately.

The DRC has no way to actually force professors to give you academic accomodations that you request, and I have heard of people having problems with this. If the academic accommodations you need are extensive, I'd call or email the DRC at UCSC and explain what you explained above, let them know what accomodations you would need/expect, and ask if students ever have problems getting those accomodations. I don't know which accomodations tend to cause problems.

As the other commenter said, the campus is physically very inaccessible. There is an e-bike share company that came in this year that seems to be pretty popular that you might have luck with, and there is also a disability van service, but I've heard mixed reviews on the van service's reliability. If you can get in and out of a bus (with stairs, no ramps) then loop busses should help a lot with your getting around campus as long and you don't schedule back-to-back classes, but there are some parts of campus that the loop busses don't get very close to and you may still have to walk around half a mile (with hills and stairs) from the closest bus stop to wherever you're going. I love taking my e-bike to campus as it helps me get around a lot faster, but I live off campus and can store my ebike on my 2nd-storey balcony where theft would be rather difficult. I don't know if the bike storage for people who live on campus would be adequate for you to not have an e-bike stolen if you were living on campus and wanted your own e-bike instead of using the e-bike share. 

From my experience at both community college and UCSC, community colleges tend to be much more disability friendly than UCSC is in basically all regards. I would look into community college and transferring as an option to save money and to also get used to college coursework somewhere where accomodations are more normalized and honestly where the professors actually give a shit about their students. Many lower division classes are so large at UCSC that the professors literally don't have time to care about any of their students, and the quality of teaching you'll get from TAs varies dramatically. At community college I found all of my professors very willing to make time to help students who needed it, and that's just not the vibe from professors here. Obviously your mileage may vary at a different community college than the one I went to, but I would check out your local community college options (or even cabrillo and de anza, which are the CC's closest to UCSC) and see if they look like a good fit for you, too, and then you can transfer to UCSC with a trabsfer agreement guarantee (for most majors), too."
kcgd21f,18d84jf,2023-12-07 19:16:21,"Do not choose this place. I’ve heard so many disabled persons complain and I do sympathize with them, but UCSC is the LEAST accessible campus for people w disabilities. Most athletic people here find themselves winded walking across campus, that says a lot."
kcgjgba,18d84jf,2023-12-07 20:05:46,"DRC is great and can help a lot, but traversing this campus as a disabled person is a nightmare."
kcg2c8h,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:57:58,"I agree with some other people on the general inaccessibility for the physical disabilities. I have totally seen people do it who are wheel chair users though. They will let you allow your ESA if you live on campus. The DRC kicks absolute ass. I can now say this firmly comparing it to the grad school that I'm at now where the disability offices sucks hard core. Furthermore, UCSC is the school that introduced me to disability studies! There is a better culture there than I've personally experienced otherwise. I hated to leave it."
kcfu4e0,18d84jf,2023-12-07 16:57:53,"As far as academic accommodations go, it is not difficult to get them from the DRC. But the way that accommodations are done at ucsc require you to at hand in your accommodations without anonymity. And it’s not uncommon for professors to either reject some or all accommodations. Other schools do anonymous grading or at least anonymous accommodations so you do not have that power dynamic."
kcg6byh,18d84jf,2023-12-07 18:26:26,Personally I’ve heard negative things including someone who had to call the ambulance on themselves or having to treat their hidden disability themselves because the health service wouldn’t listen to them. I’m not disabled but just from the terrain I personally wouldn’t recommend it
kcioin5,18d84jf,2023-12-08 08:39:09,"Hello! For a short period of time, I ripped my ankle and I was unable to walk for a while. I live on campus and UCSC's TAPS has a van called ""Disability Van Service"" and they would pick you up at a specific area and drop you off wherever you need to get to. It was very nice but DVS only goes to specific areas and sometimes you'd need to walk for a pretty long to get anywhere regardless. I ended up going home because UCSC was not very disabled accommodating (uneven paths, unwalkable areas). I can’t speak much for mental disabilities. They do have the DRC (disability resource centers) which they're are able to assist in requesting accommodation for classes and such. Hope this helps :)"
kcjr126,18d84jf,2023-12-08 12:46:25,I recommend calling and connecting with the DRC apartment ahead of time and asking them questions !!
kcg12hp,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:48:38,"Believe it or not, I had a friend in a wheelchair that got around pretty well on campus. It's a large hilly campus but you'll meet so many great friends that will help you out and disability services will be on top of your needs but it's a great question to bring up just because it is such a beautiful scenic area. You probably already do this but you must allow yourself plenty of time to get to your class because even with students with a good walking stride, it takes time to get around. Mental health wise, this university has to be the most calming relaxing chill UC in the state because it's out in nature, quiet, and there's always a quiet place to take a nap. The worst campus for mental health has to be UCLA, and I speak from experience."

kclffjc,18d84jf,2023-12-08 20:22:33,"Disability related topic aside, your description of the genesis of UCSC is wildly inaccurate and based on fake old rumors rather than reality.

  
The decentrailized design has nothing to do with the Berkley free speech movements and everything to do with the campus being designed and patterned after the Oxford model of education. Decentralized, broken down into smaller communities.  Google is your friend, check it out and don't take my word for it.  


Sorry to drop hard on you, but I'm tired of the fantasy histories that people retell like it's fact, when it's not.  Similar to the poppycock stories about how Porter was designed by the same architect who designed San Quentin...it's all fake news and poorly researched opinion."

kckd7fc,18d84jf,2023-12-08 15:17:00,"Hi, I broke my foot in April and can confirm that UCSC is not disability friendly if you have mobility/walking issues. Often times the paths to class have high inclines or staircases with no alternative paths. It was a rough two months getting to class and going anywhere on campus."
kcqloo9,18d84jf,2023-12-09 22:38:18,"i’m disabled as well and the school has been pretty accommodating for me, but if you have any difficulty involving movement (ie. wheelchair) then the school can be very unfriendly. if you have any classes at merrill especially it can be rough and the buses aren’t great for that"

kcfj8ji,18d84jf,2023-12-07 15:39:39,do they allow electric bikes on campus and if so do you think that would work getting from class to class? I can ride them for short distances but i know some campuses banned them
kcflinh,18d84jf,2023-12-07 15:55:49,Yes! E-bikes are essential with the hills.

kcg03xq,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:41:39,"The DRC at UCSC is super helpful. I can’t speak for whatever department you plan to join, but I forum no problem moving in with my ESA. We did have to share a room, but my roommates were awesome. There are 24 hour libraries/writing centers, lots of variety at the different dining halls, and plenty of clubs and activities to join. 

They have a program for DRC students that digitizes all your textbooks if you want, so you can listen to them as audiobooks. There’s math tutoring. There’s the potential to request accommodations for more time on tests and assignments. You might qualify for short breaks during exams. 

And there is a vanpool you can call for mobility issues and rides to your campus if you are physically disabled. We had a man in a wheelchair in our year, and he said they were super accommodating. 

I will say if you are physically disabled it will be hard to access some of the best parts of campus life, hiking in the old growth preserve. I got published for some photography I did back there. It was awesome. 

I found no resistance to the accommodations I requested, but again that’s professor and department dependent. 

Finally, there is a reputation for research being highly accessible for undergraduates (if you keep up in your studies and make an effort in office hours). 

All in all, despite it being an extremely expensive place to live, the busses around town allow students to venture out and make it back to campus easily. There’s loads of support for mental health. The outdoors really provide space for exercise and meditation and adventure. You can even take up surfing if you’ve never tried it. There’s also sailing classes for free down at the harbor. 

Ps. Our nickname is UC Sexy Calves. Even if you bike, which is super fun around campus and down to the beach, be prepared for lots of time outdoors and a challenging course load you must balance with your mental health. 

UCSC is a top university in science reasearch and publishing. Make sure you get organized and disciplined and prepare to work. Your degree will take you far."
kcg2d4g,18d84jf,2023-12-07 17:58:08,Thank you!! This made me feel a ton better.  If you feel comfortable would it be okay if I asked you questions about like the process of getting an ESA approved?

2) Clumped up, which can happen naturally over the course of a wash cycle.

Either way, from what I see in your video, your clothes will turn out just the same as usual if you do nothing. Plus the washing machine is built to tolerate severe vibration without any damage. 

You'd literally need to [put a cinderblock into the washer](https://youtu.be/vROdVsU_K80?si=gr53zCwJZp84WM7c) in order for it to break from unbalancing. Or a similarly heavy and dense clump of clothes.  It's for this reason that you're not supposed to pack clothes into a washer.

kcg6wdy,18d9r9c,2023-12-07 18:30:33,"Okay, that's what I thought you were talking about. The load in the washer is either: 

1) Unbalanced, too much size difference in things you're washing.
2) Clumped up, which can happen naturally over the course of a wash cycle.

Either way, from what I see in your video, your clothes will turn out just the same as usual if you do nothing. Plus the washing machine is built to tolerate severe vibration without any damage.

We don’t have information about students from the Middle East who might be permanent residents or whose parents might be here on work visas, though.   


As others have mentioned, the overall numbers of international students from the Middle East are not that high compared to other regions. Iran, however, is among the top 10 countries of origin for our international graduate students. Still, not a huge number of students from there. 

You can of course also DM me. I work in GE."

not trying to argue, ur point is fair, but latter makes it sound like spectators are acceptable and its the photos that aren't. that distinction seems like it'd be important if spectating is frowned upon. 

edit to clarify: that was the reason why my roommates and I thought it was ok, because we had seen that rule and figured if spectating was discouraged, it would be stated specifically (just like photos being discouraged)"
kc62xbb,18bl8gk,2023-12-05 17:17:39,"For starters, there is nobody to make the suggest parameter rules that you seek. This is an organic student driven tradition, not an administrative event. Ergo, there are no clearly defined rules, or spokespersons defining the event.

kc6y7cm,18bl8gk,2023-12-05 21:23:32,What happened? What mishap?
kc8rqzg,18bl8gk,2023-12-06 08:24:54,"To my knowledge, a couple rape situations at forest parties, several ODs, someone promoting acid-drop parties on campus last Spring. LOTS of citizen complaints down in the flats about loud parties (the tech bro NIMBYs who bought houses here for 2M during the last few years do not want loud drunk vomiting college partiers next door).

All resulting in many on and off campus parties being rolled, and cautionary statements being issued by admin about various ""hazardous"" festivities. Its as if the university is actually trying to take responsibility for what goes on here...shocking."
kcdtt25,18bl8gk,2023-12-07 08:42:44,"University students are adults (with a very few 17-year-old exceptions).  
Off campus students are adult members of the local community.  
Neighbors who don't like loud parties and who call the cops frequently were a thing long before tech bros were a thing.

The university shouldn't be taking responsibility for the behavior of adults, and it is unfortunate how quickly the greater culture has shifted towards assuming/expecting that they should.

The pool thing is different.  The pool pump/filters can be damaged by muddy swimmers (this happened last year), and it's entirely reasonable for the university to protect its property.

If you want to run naked in the rain, then go run naked in the rain!  It doesn't matter if it's the first rain, the last rain, or just a rainy afternoon in January.  It doesn't matter if you're alone or with a group of hundreds, or whether it's midnight or two in the afternoon.  Don't trash the campus and F things up for other people and we'll all be fine.

If you don't like being naked in public or don't like running, then don't run naked in public.  But you shouldn't feel the need to stop others from doing so -- they're really not harming you, and you have an infinite number of other things that you can choose to do instead."
kd5o3ae,18bl8gk,2023-12-13 00:38:10,"Indecent exposure is a crime. While most of the people who live on campus are 18-22, there are still children on campus in family student housing. I don't understand why people need to tolerate this."
kd7twko,18bl8gk,2023-12-13 11:09:37,"""Oh, Won't someone think of the CHILDREN‽""

Indecent Exposure IS a crime, well-defined in state law ([Penal Code §314(1)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=314.&lawCode=PEN)), but it's not the crime you believe it to be.  

Indecent Exposure is not merely ""This person is naked in public where kids or the easily-offended can see them"" (That describes the act of ""Public Nudity"" which is criminalized in some counties/cities).  Indecent Exposure requires the the person who is naked or willfully exposing themselves to also be doing so ""lewdly"" and to be intending to offend or annoy.  This is why nude beaches are generally legal in the state, even on public land.

A group naked run in the rain is a lot closer to the ""people at the nude beach"" standard than it is to the ""crackhead masturbating on the bus"" standard (which \*is\* indecent exposure).

Case law has defined the ""acting lewdly"" threshold for indecent exposure as  ""...intending to direct public attention to (his/her) genitals for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying (himself/herself) or another person, or sexually offending another person.""  (This language is directly from the California [jury instructions](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/1000/1160/) \-- it is the \*actual\* standard that juries are asked to follow when determining whether someone is guilty of violating this law). 

Getting naked (or topless if you're female) to run in the rain on a public college campus, to sunbathe on Davenport Beach, or to change out of your wetsuit on the sidewalk near Pleasure Point while waiting for a breakfast burrito, simply does not meet this standard.  Even if there are kids around to point and laugh at you.

There was a bunch of press around this in 1992 when UC Berkeley had a naked student (they eventually expelled him), and again in 2012 when San Francisco had a contingent of men regularly hanging dong at the corner of Market and Castro.  [KQED News has a very good roundup](https://www.kqed.org/news/11613510/the-history-of-nudity-in-san-francisco-uncovered) of those.

Both San Francisco and Berkeley now have public nudity laws.  Santa Cruz doesn't, except for [on the beaches in the ""urban"" areas](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruzCounty/#!/SantaCruzCounty08/SantaCruzCounty0816.html#8.16.030) (in practice: Main Beach, Capitola Beach), where it's an infraction with a $100 fine."

kcb16on,18bl8gk,2023-12-06 17:04:51,"TIL that public nudity was made a violation of the UCSC student code of conduct in 2015.

Prior to that, UCSC students were quite proud of their clothing optional campus, though very few actually made use of that policy.  There was a time when it was seemingly traditional to drop trou whenever a campus tour would stop by one of the residential campuses.

Public Nudity is not illegal in most of California, unless one is being ""indecent"", which requires a sexual element.  Simply existing (or running) while being naked is not considered to be sexual in nature and is not illegal by itself in Santa Cruz."
kc5zf2l,18bl8gk,2023-12-05 16:51:36,"Yes, but it is the trespassing that is mentioned as illegal in the email. It's probably unrealistic to stop the nudity, even though that is illegal too"

All resulting in many on and off campus parties being rolled, and cautionary statements being issued by admin about various ""hazardous"" festivities. Its as if the university is actually trying to take responsibility for what goes on here...shocking."
kcdtt25,18bl8gk,2023-12-07 08:42:44,"University students are adults (with a very few 17-year-old exceptions).  
Off campus students are adult members of the local community.  
Neighbors who don't like loud parties and who call the cops frequently were a thing long before tech bros were a thing.

The university shouldn't be taking responsibility for the behavior of adults, and it is unfortunate how quickly the greater culture has shifted towards assuming/expecting that they should.

The pool thing is different.  The pool pump/filters can be damaged by muddy swimmers (this happened last year), and it's entirely reasonable for the university to protect its property.

If you want to run naked in the rain, then go run naked in the rain!  It doesn't matter if it's the first rain, the last rain, or just a rainy afternoon in January.  It doesn't matter if you're alone or with a group of hundreds, or whether it's midnight or two in the afternoon.  Don't trash the campus and F things up for other people and we'll all be fine.

If you don't like being naked in public or don't like running, then don't run naked in public.  But you shouldn't feel the need to stop others from doing so -- they're really not harming you, and you have an infinite number of other things that you can choose to do instead."
kd5o3ae,18bl8gk,2023-12-13 00:38:10,"Indecent exposure is a crime. While most of the people who live on campus are 18-22, there are still children on campus in family student housing. I don't understand why people need to tolerate this."
kd7twko,18bl8gk,2023-12-13 11:09:37,"""Oh, Won't someone think of the CHILDREN‽""

Indecent Exposure IS a crime, well-defined in state law ([Penal Code §314(1)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=314.&lawCode=PEN)), but it's not the crime you believe it to be.  

Indecent Exposure is not merely ""This person is naked in public where kids or the easily-offended can see them"" (That describes the act of ""Public Nudity"" which is criminalized in some counties/cities).  Indecent Exposure requires the the person who is naked or willfully exposing themselves to also be doing so ""lewdly"" and to be intending to offend or annoy.  This is why nude beaches are generally legal in the state, even on public land.

A group naked run in the rain is a lot closer to the ""people at the nude beach"" standard than it is to the ""crackhead masturbating on the bus"" standard (which \*is\* indecent exposure).

Case law has defined the ""acting lewdly"" threshold for indecent exposure as  ""...intending to direct public attention to (his/her) genitals for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying (himself/herself) or another person, or sexually offending another person.""  (This language is directly from the California [jury instructions](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/1000/1160/) \-- it is the \*actual\* standard that juries are asked to follow when determining whether someone is guilty of violating this law). 

Getting naked (or topless if you're female) to run in the rain on a public college campus, to sunbathe on Davenport Beach, or to change out of your wetsuit on the sidewalk near Pleasure Point while waiting for a breakfast burrito, simply does not meet this standard.  Even if there are kids around to point and laugh at you.

There was a bunch of press around this in 1992 when UC Berkeley had a naked student (they eventually expelled him), and again in 2012 when San Francisco had a contingent of men regularly hanging dong at the corner of Market and Castro.  [KQED News has a very good roundup](https://www.kqed.org/news/11613510/the-history-of-nudity-in-san-francisco-uncovered) of those.

Both San Francisco and Berkeley now have public nudity laws.  Santa Cruz doesn't, except for [on the beaches in the ""urban"" areas](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruzCounty/#!/SantaCruzCounty08/SantaCruzCounty0816.html#8.16.030) (in practice: Main Beach, Capitola Beach), where it's an infraction with a $100 fine."

kcb16on,18bl8gk,2023-12-06 17:04:51,"TIL that public nudity was made a violation of the UCSC student code of conduct in 2015.

Prior to that, UCSC students were quite proud of their clothing optional campus, though very few actually made use of that policy.  There was a time when it was seemingly traditional to drop trou whenever a campus tour would stop by one of the residential campuses.

Public Nudity is not illegal in most of California, unless one is being ""indecent"", which requires a sexual element.  Simply existing (or running) while being naked is not considered to be sexual in nature and is not illegal by itself in Santa Cruz."
kc5zf2l,18bl8gk,2023-12-05 16:51:36,"Yes, but it is the trespassing that is mentioned as illegal in the email. It's probably unrealistic to stop the nudity, even though that is illegal too"

kc5y8zs,18bl8gk,2023-12-05 16:43:04,"in that case, may I suggest saying ""spectating is heavily discouraged"" rather than just ""spectators are heavily discouraged from taking photos""?

not trying to argue, ur point is fair, but latter makes it sound like spectators are acceptable and its the photos that aren't. that distinction seems like it'd be important if spectating is frowned upon. 

edit to clarify: that was the reason why my roommates and I thought it was ok, because we had seen that rule and figured if spectating was discouraged, it would be stated specifically (just like photos being discouraged)"

kcdtt25,18bl8gk,2023-12-07 08:42:44,"University students are adults (with a very few 17-year-old exceptions).  
Off campus students are adult members of the local community.  
Neighbors who don't like loud parties and who call the cops frequently were a thing long before tech bros were a thing.

The university shouldn't be taking responsibility for the behavior of adults, and it is unfortunate how quickly the greater culture has shifted towards assuming/expecting that they should.

The pool thing is different.  The pool pump/filters can be damaged by muddy swimmers (this happened last year), and it's entirely reasonable for the university to protect its property.

If you want to run naked in the rain, then go run naked in the rain!  It doesn't matter if it's the first rain, the last rain, or just a rainy afternoon in January.  It doesn't matter if you're alone or with a group of hundreds, or whether it's midnight or two in the afternoon.  Don't trash the campus and F things up for other people and we'll all be fine.

If you don't like being naked in public or don't like running, then don't run naked in public.  But you shouldn't feel the need to stop others from doing so -- they're really not harming you, and you have an infinite number of other things that you can choose to do instead."

Indecent Exposure IS a crime, well-defined in state law ([Penal Code §314(1)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=314.&lawCode=PEN)), but it's not the crime you believe it to be.  

Indecent Exposure is not merely ""This person is naked in public where kids or the easily-offended can see them"" (That describes the act of ""Public Nudity"" which is criminalized in some counties/cities).  Indecent Exposure requires the the person who is naked or willfully exposing themselves to also be doing so ""lewdly"" and to be intending to offend or annoy.  This is why nude beaches are generally legal in the state, even on public land.

A group naked run in the rain is a lot closer to the ""people at the nude beach"" standard than it is to the ""crackhead masturbating on the bus"" standard (which \*is\* indecent exposure).

Case law has defined the ""acting lewdly"" threshold for indecent exposure as  ""...intending to direct public attention to (his/her) genitals for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying (himself/herself) or another person, or sexually offending another person.""  (This language is directly from the California [jury instructions](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/1000/1160/) \-- it is the \*actual\* standard that juries are asked to follow when determining whether someone is guilty of violating this law). 

Getting naked (or topless if you're female) to run in the rain on a public college campus, to sunbathe on Davenport Beach, or to change out of your wetsuit on the sidewalk near Pleasure Point while waiting for a breakfast burrito, simply does not meet this standard.  Even if there are kids around to point and laugh at you.

There was a bunch of press around this in 1992 when UC Berkeley had a naked student (they eventually expelled him), and again in 2012 when San Francisco had a contingent of men regularly hanging dong at the corner of Market and Castro.  [KQED News has a very good roundup](https://www.kqed.org/news/11613510/the-history-of-nudity-in-san-francisco-uncovered) of those.

Both San Francisco and Berkeley now have public nudity laws.  Santa Cruz doesn't, except for [on the beaches in the ""urban"" areas](https://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruzCounty/#!/SantaCruzCounty08/SantaCruzCounty0816.html#8.16.030) (in practice: Main Beach, Capitola Beach), where it's an infraction with a $100 fine."

Requesting proof or verification for further accommodation is DRCs job not the professor. They are only required to provide as much reasonable accommodation as DRC requests.

Still, I wouldn't have shared medical records with your professor.

UCSC needs to establish an anonymous grading system. Accommodations should be anonymous and approved by the DRC, and it ends there. A DRC person should ensure accommodations are complied with as an intermediary between students and faculty."

kc2t0um,18azlpb,2023-12-05 02:02:33,That’s not how accommodations work. I don’t ask for anything. It’s the DRC that states what accommodations I should be given. The DRC writes a letter and sends it to the teachers. Some of my accommodations that I was given by the DRC does include extensions on assignments up to 48 hours after the due date. This was something my instructor refused to do
kc5o993,18azlpb,2023-12-05 15:29:41,"An instructor is required to grant all _reasonable_ accommodations requested by the DRC on behalf of a student. Instructors can’t ask about the reason for the accommodations. Occasional 48 hour extensions seems pretty reasonable, but extensions on **all** assignments may not be, depending on the class.

The “reasonableness” of a 48 hour extension on **all** assignments _is_ something an instructor can push back on. I gave _every_ student in 13S two “no questions asked” 48 hour extensions that could be used on any assignments they chose. Since assignments were never shorter than a week and there was _always_ an outstanding assignment, I said that additional (or longer) extensions were incompatible with the course goal of completing all assignments by the end of the quarter since assignments built on previous assignments. No pushback from the DRC.

In general, my response to requests for extra time on week-long assignments is that I expect students to spend about 15 hours per week on a 5 credit class. If a student needs extra time (say, 2x, or 30 hours), there’s still plenty of time for that in a week. Such a student can’t take a full course load (30x3 = 90 hours, which _is_ excessive), but that’s to be expected if they need twice as much time as everyone else. The DRC rep I spoke with (in conjunction with a particular student’s case) agreed with me, and said the student should consider taking 10 rather than 15 units a quarter."
kc5u5u1,18azlpb,2023-12-05 16:12:59,"My 48 hour extension is only used occasionally and is not due to me taking longer on the homework than others.

kc32jpy,18azlpb,2023-12-05 04:07:53,"Instructors cannot do what that one did. It's a HIPAA violation, and more.

I gave _every_ student in 13S two “no questions asked” 48 hour extensions that could be used on any assignments they chose. Since assignments were never shorter than a week and there was _always_ an outstanding assignment, I said that additional (or longer) extensions were incompatible with the course goal of completing all assignments by the end of the quarter since assignments built on previous assignments. No pushback from the DRC.

In general, my response to requests for extra time on week-long assignments is that I expect students to spend about 15 hours per week on a 5 credit class. If a student needs extra time (say, 2x, or 30 hours), there’s still plenty of time for that in a week. Such a student can’t take a full course load (30x3 = 90 hours, which _is_ excessive), but that’s to be expected if they need twice as much time as everyone else.

kc2149q,18b1le9,2023-12-04 20:31:49,"To start, the area is incredibly beautiful. By far my favorite part of living here. The social clicks are kinda tricky if you dont make a friend group early on, but if youre pretty extroverted you should be fine. You should research the different residential colleges though to make sure you end up in the right social environment. Its a little tricky to get around if you wanna explore outside of the immediate area, but the bus system will connect you around town and theres plenty of things to do. The academic experience is different for every major but for impacted majors classes usually fill up super fast. I recommend walking to your classes instead of using the busses but its a big campus so walks can take up to 25 minutes. Dining hall food is alright, nothing special but not terrible. There are a few alternates in terms of food that you can use your meal points on too. Im not a huge partier but ive been to a few of the forest parties and ive had an amazing time at all of them. The nightclub in downtown also hosts events that lots of people say rlly good things about. Either way, i think its a super cool school and i would say you should definitely keep looking into it! if you have any questions feel free to ask"

kc2d4ux,18b1le9,2023-12-04 22:28:15,"A lot of clubs for a lot of stuff. Very weed heavy culture so most parties are naturally kick backs with a lot of smoking unless it’s a house party off campus. Mostly chill vibes. In terms of education if you put in the effort and use the resources you’ll get a whole lot of it. Staying fit mostly consists of doing sports and other activities in clubs since the gym is so small. Food is decent, nothing terrible but not great either. The campus itself is beautiful and I would recommend if you can to never take the bus and walk everywhere. Nothing is more than a 20-30 min walk away. So if you have time to do so I’d strongly recommend it. Again strong emphasis on clubs, there will 100% be something you’ll enjoy and find interesting. The people in my 4 years there were always accommodating, nice, non combative and chill. Honestly a good school if you don’t fall into the “stats and rankings” pit. That negativity is the only thing that will ruin your experience."

kcicfz8,18b1le9,2023-12-08 07:20:21,"Yes, UCSC is the type of place you either love or hate. Definitely visit — more than once — and join the UCSC related social media to get a feel for the overall experience. Also be prepared financially to spend a bundle on housing…and if you don’t like weed, don’t come here."
kc4na4o,18b1le9,2023-12-05 11:28:31,"Housing is difficult to get and expensive. There’s no sugar coating it, it’s one of the craziest housing markets in CA.

There isn’t really a party culture here. People hang out with friends at kickbacks mostly. You gotta go to at least one forest party just to experience it imo, but they get old quick. There’s a couple campus clubs and frats that host parties but it’s mostly freshmen who go to those. The dive bars downtown and elsewhere in SC are fun for 21+. There’s not much nightlife for the clubbing type of people, but I personally love the “grungier” side of SC’s bars. Some students in bands put on garage shows, which are fun. A lot of people smoke weed, and those who don’t are not bothered by it. If you’re bothered by weed, don’t come here. 4/20 is basically an unofficial holiday here.

People here are generally really easy going and friendly. The school is very left leaning, no surprise there. The academic culture is not at all competitive. Sometimes the activism culture can feel performative, and on the other hand there’s a lot of people who get pissy and grumble about any sort of protest even though they chose to go to a school that’s known for counterculture and activism. Both are annoying.

Students aren’t really involved in the town community, which is a shame. Campus is kind of its own entity. The community is pretty skeptical of students because of that. It’s a shame bc the locals here are friendly and there’s so much rich culture (surfing, remnants of anti-Vietnam), but very few people at UCSC seem to want to interact with them much."
kc2liqg,18b1le9,2023-12-05 00:14:00,"as someone who spent a few years already here at ucsc and has visited ucb, LA, and orange county i’d say they are quite different. to my knowledge of the few places i’ve been, la feels like a more sketchy berkeley while orange county would be like the rural outskirts but i do love the outlet there. ucsc is more like small city with beautiful campus and beach but lacks a ton of big brands. if you want some big brand products you’d have to try online to closest would be San Jose. Here downtown i’ve only seen a few clothing stores, jewelry, crafts store, food, food, and oh did i mention food? haha

it’s definitely nicer than orange county id say but has less and is just a smaller city"
kc3s1rf,18b1le9,2023-12-05 08:07:23,"It's a very small town with very little to do, so if you don't figure out a way to have fun on your own accord you'll be extremely bored. Seeing that you're from OC, I would definitely visit first and just ask random students any questions you have. Most ppl here are very nice compared to other schools they won't mind answering your questions. 

Coming here will be the absolute opposite of the OC/LA experience. There is no city life unless you want to drive up to the Bay all the time, but it's a lengthy drive and it's not really worth it unless you're doing it with other people. If a big city-esque nightlife/social scene is really important to you, I would definitely think twice before coming here. 

I won't get too much into the educational side as it's major dependent, but I'd say the professors are pretty good (lots of good ones, some bad ones) and you'll learn a lot from every course if you really put the effort in. I'm a CS major for clarification. The GE's here are definitely lacking compared to other schools (just not as many interesting offerings); I'd honestly say that most GE's I took felt like a waste of time so do with that what you will.

I think the worst part of this school is the lack of facilities/amenities. We just simply have nonexistent/lacking facilities here. We have one, tiny gym in a pretty inconvenient location and it is extremely crowded 80% of the time it's open (Expect a 1 hour workout at your commercial gym to take 2 hours here). We have one, small basketball court which is also used for badminton, volleyball, and other sports so you'll basically never have an opportunity to use it. There are also no real community centers that make it easy to meet people (for reference UCSD has sky lounges, cafes, restaurants on campus, computer labs, and they just built a brand new esports center just for students). Our dorms don't have communal kitchens, we don't really have central quad areas, central marketplaces, or anything like that. 

TL;DR: Good people, nice-looking campus, generally good professors/classes, small boring city, terrible/nonexistent amenities at the school"

kc4r98d,18b1le9,2023-12-05 11:54:07,"Campus is beautiful, but housing is total garbage.  You can get something much nicer for the same price per month down in Irvine. The following may also apply to you if you don’t plan to cook: they reworked the dining plans so that you pay for a limited amount of swipes per quarter rather than the unlimited 7/5 day plan of before, which is another way they milk money from first year/transfer students

Idk if UCI still has a tag program or how it could affect your career plans, but it may be the better move for you financially"

kc3osw3,18b1le9,2023-12-05 07:45:07,"Make sure you get into the right college/dorm your freshman year. A lot of kids go on Instagram to find a roommate they get along with. I'm a nosey Mom and from my point of view either kids love it or hate it there. My son loves it. He ended up on a floor in Cowell with super cool kids and they instantly all became best friends. They take the bus downtown, some raves, and a few parties, but love Bonfires on the beach, game nights, and hanging out in the trees. You find things to do that you are interested in like one boy surfs and a girl scuba dives, another in the orchestra or there are a lot of academic clubs. My son lifeguards and plays club water polo. He says it's true that almost everyone there smokes pot. Some moms complain their freshmen have a hard time making friends but honestly, there are tons of things to do. Each college hosts events and if you put yourself out there you will find your tribe. It's nothing like UCLA. My son's girlfriend goes there and says UCSC is much more chill. I think people care less about what others think. It's a lot quieter which you can take for more peaceful and relaxing or boring, up to you. Hope this helps!"

In terms of the campus itself, you honestly couldn't find a better one. It's rated as one of the most beautiful campus in the US and it makes sense. Only bummer is sometimes u gotta break a good sweat getting to class. As for things to do off campus there is a good amount to keep u busy. Going to different beaches, going downtown, boardwalk, hiking, beach volleyball, etc. also lots of cool shops. Party culture is definitely large but not as big as other schools like UCSB. Most parties are on campus in the forest and you can find a few off campus house parties as well. Unless ur in a frat which is also not as big as other schools there aren't a ton of parties happening. Stoner culture is definitely very real here 90% of the people I know smoke at least socially. But there are also lots of people who don't as well it's all who you hang with but for the most part majority do in my experience."

I am obviously not here to defend the mid-age online man being creepy, but you really gotta stop making same drama to get karmas and interests on reddit. This shit is enough for what you have done to me and in my server. Stop being on virtual world and start acting like 24 years old adult in real life.

kc789w6,18bu1nd,2023-12-05 23:15:33,"I hate to comment on this. But this drama is so petty. You all are at university level studies and not in some high school classroom. I’m very shocked to see this level of immaturity now with community collaboration.

Focus on your finals and your final assignments. Don’t worry about this person. Arguing back and forth takes away time from potentially a higher grade and getting help from your peers, professor, and/or TAs.

If you feel that this person is a harassing students though, please bring this forth to the professor, TAs, or the deans office."

My current understanding is 103 with Bailey is theory and tests heavy with doable weekly homework, but the tests are very lecture related.

For 102, I understand it is also theory heavy but extremely proofs based with heavy HW.

kbz0h0t,18an37w,2023-12-04 08:46:35,"1. Professors are generally nice, though youll have the occasional difficult one like at any university
2. depends on your major completely. Some majors will have high workload (particularily STEM), some will not. Most lectures are not really interactive, since they are a means for the professor to convey information to you, however if your major requires supplemental labs then those are more interactive.
3. Food is ok, its sometimes hit or miss. Its meant to appeal to everyones palette. Havent personally lived in the dorms myself but I know people who have. It completely depends on the college you get in. Kresge will have super modern dorms, while Crown's dorms are outdated and really packed. On campus apartments are way better.
4. This is probably one of the most liberal colleges in america. Actually I think it is ranked as the most liberal college in america. Racism is not at worry here. Diversity completely depends on what major you are, what college your at, etc. In general its a pretty diverse school, you can find the statistics online somewhere.
5. Housing is expensive. When I was living in a triple in an on campus apartment I was paying around 1300 per month. Now I live off campus and was lucky to score a single for around 700 a month, but thats not the rule and more of the exception. On average, singles off campus are about 1300-1500 a month. Im a Computer Engineering Major, so I dont spend much on supplies, if at all. I do must of my work on my laptop or on my computer, and any material needed for my lab classes are provided by the university for me. Cant say anything about other majors though. Off campus, I spent around 200-300 a month on food, 100 on utilities. On campus, if you live in the dorms you are required to get a meal plan, which is a couple thousand per quarter? Check the dining website for meal plan prices. If you live in the on campus apartments it isnt required to get a meal plan. Apartments are only available to 2nd years and above. 

In the end, its a really nice university, but you have to realize that since you live in a different state, it will be more expensive in terms of tuition. If you have the means to pay for it and are willing to shell out 50k+ per year for a mid-low tier UC, then go ahead. If not, maybe consider other schools, even ones in your own state which can provide cheaper tuition to NY state residents."

Everyone I’ve talked to in the physics department has been very nice as well. Haven’t met a single person I’ve found rude.

As for work life balance. From talking to a few of my professors it seems like they have minimal work life balance, but it also seems like that is by choice because of how much they like the field.

Santa Cruz as a town is fine. There are some nice locations but everything closes too early for my liking. However it is undoubtably amazing for hiking, mountain biking, climbing, surfing and anything nature. The campus is right in the middle of the redwoods and has some world renowned mountain biking trails.

Housing however is a big issue, Santa Cruz is also very well known for us cost of housing issues."

You're working a job, not a soapbox. Focus on your wage and practice and discuss politics off the clock. At least that way you're not going to lose an income over a disagreement that could have been totally avoided. Shit's expensive here in SC, make sure you're personally in a good and secure spot before engaging in activities or discussions that could jeopardize your means of living.

Honestly though, it sounds like he's at least willing to deeply discuss the depths of his beliefs and politics. Many people on either side of the political spectrum are only willing to regurgitate what their favorite politico says, then just start repeating themselves when questioned further.

One of the shitty parts of life is that the further you get the more you just let this stuff go. Not that you should let *everything* go, but you really gotta pick your battles when it can affect your career, family, or livelihood, and esp when it just relates to someone’s shitty opinions.

Try to look out for your mental health, though, and maybe look for a way to get out of the shitty situation, cuz this can eat you up emotionally. I had a similar situation (albeit different in most ways), and I just bit my tongue and took the time to figure out better options. That’s part of what motivated me to go back to school, quit that job, and transfer here. Turned out to be one of the best things I’ve ever done.

kbvwjz0,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 15:59:19,"You should learn to dissociate your politics, beliefs, and ideals from random people. It’s a coworker, not someone you’re opting to spend time with by choice. If you can’t handle peoples beliefs differing from yours, you shouldn’t force everyone to discuss those topics with you. 

You’ll encounter plenty of people who’s beliefs, ideas, and lives vastly differ from yours. Even in an isolated environment, people differ greatly. You can express yourself as you please, but you sound like a ‘deplorable’ person to be forced to be around (like a coworker) if you force political discussions, can’t handle different beliefs, and want to be violent with people who aren’t alike to you.

You sound very passionate, and you’re likely in an environment where that is supported and nurtured. Good for you. Many people do not have that opportunity. There are plenty of people I think behave like ‘idiots’ but I don’t exist despising everyone who’s not like me. You shouldn’t further discuss these things with others who don’t share your opinions if you can’t handle it. Regardless if it’s due to ignorance, uneducated, or lack of awareness, it’s not your responsibility or right to berate people for politics or social topics they likely have little care for.

kbxfb7v,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:37:07,"You're coworker is definitely a nutjob if he believes in Greater Israel. The Jewish claims to Jordan were basically abandoned after the Holocaust.

Let me ask, if Pearl Harbor happened today, would you support bombing/invading Japan, or would you call for a ceasefire? Certainly you wouldn't consider the far deadlier US invasion of Japan to be a genocide, right?"
kbxfwy8,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:45:00,"Bro there's a difference between 2 comparable militaries. Gaza is half children and the most densely populated area in the world. And plus the raw number show that Israel has killed over 20,000 people since the attack and displaced 1.7 million people in Gaza who will never be able to go back home and Israel is trying to displaced them into Egypt.
This is not equivalent to pearl harbor this is equivalent to 9/11 and the war on terror. The war on terror killed many times more civilians than combatants than what the US did to Japan and Germany. If it was ww2 I would've not advocated for bombing of Dresden. Collective punishment is not the answer. And also Israel used this as justification to arm settlers in the West Bank and bomb areas of the west Bank control by the PLO not hamas. So evidently this is a genocide and the international community agrees except for of course Israel and other western countries and India cause they also hate muslims."
kbxh60d,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:01:32,"First of all, this war started with Hamas infiltrating Israeli territory for the sole purpose of slaughtering civilians and taking hostages. There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there's no option other than going in and taking them out.

Israel doesn't get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can't believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can't believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas's responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel's coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.

Israel ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.

Genocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.

The West Bank is ""controlled"" by the PLO, but Hamas, PIJ, and the Lion's Den operate actively in the West Bank, particularly in areas like Jenin that the PLO can't control effectively. Areas controlled by those groups are without doubt valid targets.

Allied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel's response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can't let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That's simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months."
kbxicl6,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:17:27,"I agree hamas uses human shields and that they exacerbate the conditions to justify their hatred of jews. But also this could be handle with much less civilian qualities if the idf used spec ops, and used the mossad to go after the officials in Qatar. This is the equivalent of a school shooter in a school and bombing the entire school. And Israel still bombed South Gaza. Same with bombing hospitals, schools, and churches were most of the time there were no hams militants and Israel has killed several hostages in the bombing!"
kbxjflb,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:32:24,"Small, surgical operations do not have nearly enough gravity to eliminate Hamas. They were used to try to control Hamas for a decade, but obviously that didn't work out. Israel's only choice here is total regime change through military force, which involves completely wiping out Hamas's army and terror infrastructure. There is no way to do this without a lot of civilians dying in the process, which is why it wasn't on the table until October 7.

I'm personally glad this is happening now and not in 10 years. Imagine if the 1 million+ children who were educated by Hamas grew up while it was still under their control? Israel would be facing a massive indoctrinated population and an army of immense size. It's better to move now while there is still some pre-Hamas population that could contribute to nation-building after, and there is still a chance to deradicalize the youth and convince them to contribute toward positive nation-building.

This was the tactic used in Germany and Japan to massive success. Japan and Germany's wartime generations went through hell, but nowadays Germany and Japan are both democratic, free, peaceful nations, and the old hateful ideologies are mostly eradicated.

I fear that Israel ends this war with Hamas in control of anything, this will become 100 times worse."

Or “One solution, Intifada Revolution”? 

Because sorry to burst your bubble, but calling to kill/ethnically cleanse Jews from Israel/Palestine— one of the last places in the Middle East that they haven’t been ethnically cleansed from— is also genocidal. 

And by the way, if you take a look at some more polls from the PCPSR, you’ll find that majority Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza support in a 1 state solution without Jews— aka, expulsion of all Jews from the land."

One of the shitty parts of life is that the further you get the more you just let this stuff go. Not that you should let *everything* go, but you really gotta pick your battles when it can affect your career, family, or livelihood, and esp when it just relates to someone’s shitty opinions.

Try to look out for your mental health, though, and maybe look for a way to get out of the shitty situation, cuz this can eat you up emotionally. I had a similar situation (albeit different in most ways), and I just bit my tongue and took the time to figure out better options. That’s part of what motivated me to go back to school, quit that job, and transfer here. Turned out to be one of the best things I’ve ever done.

kbwvtr8,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 20:16:56,Perhaps advocating for their murder would help? It is just a political position after all.

kbxdw3k,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:18:49,I think he'a trying to say that anyone who doesn't agree with him is advocating for murder.

kbxeyj9,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:32:35,"Like I've said before I've had other discussions and disagreements with co workers.(I read all the post about how I shouldn't talk about politics in the work place I know) but they have never been out of spite or we couldn't work together in the workplace. In fact I had to calm a coworker down when three of us were discussing homelessness. For me the red line is justifying mass murder, denial of mass murder, or pro mass murder and viewing other people as inferior or other."
kbxfb7v,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:37:07,"You're coworker is definitely a nutjob if he believes in Greater Israel. The Jewish claims to Jordan were basically abandoned after the Holocaust.

Let me ask, if Pearl Harbor happened today, would you support bombing/invading Japan, or would you call for a ceasefire? Certainly you wouldn't consider the far deadlier US invasion of Japan to be a genocide, right?"
kbxfwy8,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:45:00,"Bro there's a difference between 2 comparable militaries. Gaza is half children and the most densely populated area in the world. And plus the raw number show that Israel has killed over 20,000 people since the attack and displaced 1.7 million people in Gaza who will never be able to go back home and Israel is trying to displaced them into Egypt.
This is not equivalent to pearl harbor this is equivalent to 9/11 and the war on terror. The war on terror killed many times more civilians than combatants than what the US did to Japan and Germany. If it was ww2 I would've not advocated for bombing of Dresden. Collective punishment is not the answer. And also Israel used this as justification to arm settlers in the West Bank and bomb areas of the west Bank control by the PLO not hamas. So evidently this is a genocide and the international community agrees except for of course Israel and other western countries and India cause they also hate muslims."
kbxh60d,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:01:32,"First of all, this war started with Hamas infiltrating Israeli territory for the sole purpose of slaughtering civilians and taking hostages. There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there's no option other than going in and taking them out.

Israel doesn't get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can't believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can't believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas's responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel's coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.

Israel ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.

Genocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.

The West Bank is ""controlled"" by the PLO, but Hamas, PIJ, and the Lion's Den operate actively in the West Bank, particularly in areas like Jenin that the PLO can't control effectively. Areas controlled by those groups are without doubt valid targets.

Allied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel's response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can't let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That's simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months."
kbxicl6,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:17:27,"I agree hamas uses human shields and that they exacerbate the conditions to justify their hatred of jews. But also this could be handle with much less civilian qualities if the idf used spec ops, and used the mossad to go after the officials in Qatar. This is the equivalent of a school shooter in a school and bombing the entire school. And Israel still bombed South Gaza. Same with bombing hospitals, schools, and churches were most of the time there were no hams militants and Israel has killed several hostages in the bombing!"
kbxjflb,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:32:24,"Small, surgical operations do not have nearly enough gravity to eliminate Hamas. They were used to try to control Hamas for a decade, but obviously that didn't work out. Israel's only choice here is total regime change through military force, which involves completely wiping out Hamas's army and terror infrastructure. There is no way to do this without a lot of civilians dying in the process, which is why it wasn't on the table until October 7.

I'm personally glad this is happening now and not in 10 years. Imagine if the 1 million+ children who were educated by Hamas grew up while it was still under their control? Israel would be facing a massive indoctrinated population and an army of immense size. It's better to move now while there is still some pre-Hamas population that could contribute to nation-building after, and there is still a chance to deradicalize the youth and convince them to contribute toward positive nation-building.

This was the tactic used in Germany and Japan to massive success. Japan and Germany's wartime generations went through hell, but nowadays Germany and Japan are both democratic, free, peaceful nations, and the old hateful ideologies are mostly eradicated.

Or “One solution, Intifada Revolution”? 

Because sorry to burst your bubble, but calling to kill/ethnically cleanse Jews from Israel/Palestine— one of the last places in the Middle East that they haven’t been ethnically cleansed from— is also genocidal.

kbxh60d,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:01:32,"First of all, this war started with Hamas infiltrating Israeli territory for the sole purpose of slaughtering civilians and taking hostages. There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there's no option other than going in and taking them out.

Israel doesn't get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can't believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can't believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas's responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel's coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.

Israel ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.

Genocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.

The West Bank is ""controlled"" by the PLO, but Hamas, PIJ, and the Lion's Den operate actively in the West Bank, particularly in areas like Jenin that the PLO can't control effectively. Areas controlled by those groups are without doubt valid targets.

Allied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel's response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can't let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That's simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months."

kbxklgy,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:48:46,What am I saying that's deranged?
kbzum2s,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 11:47:42,You're right and I was wrong about the 6% approval rating. I heard it from the news and I'll emit I was wrong.
kc2jiph,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 23:47:15,"Let me ask you a question: if you’re so upset by your Republican coworker who you say is spouting genocidal rhetoric, how do you feel about the massive number of UCSC students who were chanting in Arabic at the Walkout for Palestine protest “min al-mayeh lil-mayeh, Filastin arabiyeh” (from the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Arab)? Or “One solution, Intifada Revolution”? 

Because sorry to burst your bubble, but calling to kill/ethnically cleanse Jews from Israel/Palestine— one of the last places in the Middle East that they haven’t been ethnically cleansed from— is also genocidal. 

And by the way, if you take a look at some more polls from the PCPSR, you’ll find that majority Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza support in a 1 state solution without Jews— aka, expulsion of all Jews from the land."

Almost 60% of Palestinians living in Gaza or the Westbank 'extremely' support October 7th.

About 80% see Hamas as positive. Almost 100% see Israel (and the US) as negative.

About 63% see the war as between Israel and Palestinians in general, not Israel and Hamas."

This is not equivalent to pearl harbor this is equivalent to 9/11 and the war on terror. The war on terror killed many times more civilians than combatants than what the US did to Japan and Germany. If it was ww2 I would've not advocated for bombing of Dresden. Collective punishment is not the answer. And also Israel used this as justification to arm settlers in the West Bank and bomb areas of the west Bank control by the PLO not hamas. So evidently this is a genocide and the international community agrees except for of course Israel and other western countries and India cause they also hate muslims."
kbxh60d,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:01:32,"First of all, this war started with Hamas infiltrating Israeli territory for the sole purpose of slaughtering civilians and taking hostages. There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there's no option other than going in and taking them out.

Israel doesn't get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can't believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can't believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas's responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel's coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.

Israel ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.

Genocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.

The West Bank is ""controlled"" by the PLO, but Hamas, PIJ, and the Lion's Den operate actively in the West Bank, particularly in areas like Jenin that the PLO can't control effectively. Areas controlled by those groups are without doubt valid targets.

Allied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel's response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can't let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That's simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months."

Israel's only choice here is total regime change through military force, which involves completely wiping out Hamas's army and terror infrastructure. There is no way to do this without a lot of civilians dying in the process, which is why it wasn't on the table until October 7.

I'm personally glad this is happening now and not in 10 years. Imagine if the 1 million+ children who were educated by Hamas grew up while it was still under their control? Israel would be facing a massive indoctrinated population and an army of immense size. It's better to move now while there is still some pre-Hamas population that could contribute to nation-building after, and there is still a chance to deradicalize the youth and convince them to contribute toward positive nation-building.

Allied bombing raids (not even Dresden, the normal ones) were ten times as brutal as Israel's response in Gaza. Hamas is trying to exacerbate the humanitarian conditions in Gaza to try and call for a ceasefire so that they can claim victory and continue controlling Gaza. Israel can't let them hide behind a ""humanitarian"" ceasefire this time. That's simply asking for another brutal attack in 18 months."
kbxicl6,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:17:27,"I agree hamas uses human shields and that they exacerbate the conditions to justify their hatred of jews. But also this could be handle with much less civilian qualities if the idf used spec ops, and used the mossad to go after the officials in Qatar. This is the equivalent of a school shooter in a school and bombing the entire school. And Israel still bombed South Gaza. Same with bombing hospitals, schools, and churches were most of the time there were no hams militants and Israel has killed several hostages in the bombing!"
kbxjflb,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:32:24,"Small, surgical operations do not have nearly enough gravity to eliminate Hamas. They were used to try to control Hamas for a decade, but obviously that didn't work out. Israel's only choice here is total regime change through military force, which involves completely wiping out Hamas's army and terror infrastructure. There is no way to do this without a lot of civilians dying in the process, which is why it wasn't on the table until October 7.

I'm personally glad this is happening now and not in 10 years. Imagine if the 1 million+ children who were educated by Hamas grew up while it was still under their control? Israel would be facing a massive indoctrinated population and an army of immense size. It's better to move now while there is still some pre-Hamas population that could contribute to nation-building after, and there is still a chance to deradicalize the youth and convince them to contribute toward positive nation-building.

This was the tactic used in Germany and Japan to massive success. Japan and Germany's wartime generations went through hell, but nowadays Germany and Japan are both democratic, free, peaceful nations, and the old hateful ideologies are mostly eradicated.

I fear that Israel ends this war with Hamas in control of anything, this will become 100 times worse."
kbxkhvm,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:47:21,"Dude you can't be serious, you're as deranged as my coworker."
kbxklgy,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:48:46,What am I saying that's deranged?
kbxfwy8,18a5vg5,2023-12-03 23:45:00,"Bro there's a difference between 2 comparable militaries. Gaza is half children and the most densely populated area in the world. And plus the raw number show that Israel has killed over 20,000 people since the attack and displaced 1.7 million people in Gaza who will never be able to go back home and Israel is trying to displaced them into Egypt.
This is not equivalent to pearl harbor this is equivalent to 9/11 and the war on terror. The war on terror killed many times more civilians than combatants than what the US did to Japan and Germany. If it was ww2 I would've not advocated for bombing of Dresden. Collective punishment is not the answer. And also Israel used this as justification to arm settlers in the West Bank and bomb areas of the west Bank control by the PLO not hamas. So evidently this is a genocide and the international community agrees except for of course Israel and other western countries and India cause they also hate muslims."
kbxh60d,18a5vg5,2023-12-04 00:01:32,"First of all, this war started with Hamas infiltrating Israeli territory for the sole purpose of slaughtering civilians and taking hostages. There literally could not be a more justified reason to destroy Hamas. If you lived 30 minutes from a genocidal terrorist group who believed your ethnic group started WW1, you would probably not be willing to tolerate it. Allowing Hamas to exist is simply not an option for us. Since the Palestinians are unable to remove them, there's no option other than going in and taking them out.

Israel doesn't get to pick the population density or demography of Gaza. Instead of going ""I can't believe Israel is at war with a densely-populated territory where half the people are children"", you should be saying ""I can't believe Hamas would take over a densely populated civilian area full of children then use it as a base for terrorism while using those same children as human shields"". The civilian deaths are Hamas's responsibility. They launched this war knowing they were putting their human shields in danger, and made zero provisions to give them supplied during war time despite months of prior knowledge this would happen. So, try blaming them and not the people they actively tried to genocide or the country they actively tried to demolish. Also, many areas in Israel's coastal plain have the same population density, and Hamas has no problem sending unguided rockets toward them.

Israel ordering an evacuation of Northern Gaza saved lives. The conspiracy theories that Israel is trying to transfer them to Egypt are ridiculous because Israel knows Egypt would never even think of letting in masses of Gazan refugees. A population transfer would be physically impossible.

Genocide is literally the intentional destruction of an entire population. Israel is not trying to destroy the Palestinians of Gaza, not now or ever. The anti-Israel crowd has actually been throwing that allegation around for forever, despite the fact the Palestinian population has been sharply increasing since the conflict began.

kbqb2kw,189czph,2023-12-02 13:21:34,you should be fine. you’ll probably need to google how to use gdb or lldb and valgrind when you get to cse 101 but ece 13 best prepares you for cse 121
kbqhckn,189czph,2023-12-02 14:03:53,"The way cse 121 was redesigned, I would argue that ece 13 doesn’t hold an advantage anymore to prepare you for the class."
kbr3s9b,189czph,2023-12-02 16:43:10,If you take the hardware focused version of cse13 you’ll be fine.
kbr5tpc,189czph,2023-12-02 16:58:10,Wdym the hardware focused version of cse 13? You mean ece 13?
kbr60ba,189czph,2023-12-02 16:59:33,Idk if they changed it for this year but there used to be cse13s and cse13e 13 e was more embedded systems and s was more software only.
kbr68e8,189czph,2023-12-02 17:01:15,exactly ece13 is former cse13e I can vouch for that
kbr6eps,189czph,2023-12-02 17:02:36,Oh bet then yeah take ece13 if you’re more hardware oriented. You can always do more programming on your own and improve but the hardware stuff and working with the boards is a bit less accessible outside of school.

kbydh8q,189czph,2023-12-04 06:10:46,"This depends on what you want to focus I believe. If you want to get better at C programming and building your foundation there, go with CSE 13.
I also think this depends on your major.
Me personally, if I was CS I’d stay with CSE 13 since it helped me tremendously with the following upperdivs.
I feel like I’d be very stuck or at least I’d struggle a lot more if I hadn’t taken 13, which is also a difficult class in itself."

kbq3mhn,188p376,2023-12-02 12:31:14,I took it last year and there was no section the class doesn’t even have TAs
kbsdnyd,188p376,2023-12-02 23:11:19,I also enrolled in it. If ur lookin for a study buddy/new friend feel free to reach out
kc5xoo5,188p376,2023-12-05 16:38:53,no section just lecture twice a week. i suggest going to her office hours if you need help she’s very helpful and accessible. one of my favorite classes i ever took at ucsc :)
kbhk6ev,187yt7i,2023-11-30 17:33:37,"im trans and graduating this quarter. ive never had a problem. tbh I dont think the vast majority of people have noticed or cared. like other people have said, UCSC is mad liberal so ur pretty safe here. abundance of gender neutral bathrooms on campus if ur not comfortable using ur gendered bathroom for any reason yet.

trans housing is pretty fire too. dorms for first years but apartments for transfers and continuing students, and decent apartments at that. I actually think I met more enby trans people than binary, too, so being trans is super accepted. plenty of trans faculty too (also enby as far as I know, based on pronouns alone. dont know of any out binary trans profs but that doesnt mean they dont exist).

lots of UCSC policies to help protect LGBT+ people in general. worst case scenario, u reach out to faculty for an intervention (never heard of this needing to happen based on LGBT discrimination). most commonly, might need to let ur profs/peers know ur pronouns if ur misgendered. smaller classes usually have u introduce urself with pronouns tho so its a pretty uncommon occurrence. only time it happened to me, my professor apologized profusely before I even had the chance to talk to him about it lol."
kbhnx1v,187yt7i,2023-11-30 17:58:47,Thanks for explaining! UCSC sounds great in that aspect!
kbibrjk,187yt7i,2023-11-30 20:49:10,yeah I've been looking forward to it for that reason. I hope I get accepted lol

kbhjb4y,187yt7i,2023-11-30 17:27:45,"I’ve never seen anybody get harassed for being lgbt here, from my experience it’s very accepting. Ucsc students don’t really care about that stuff."

kbhvhdf,187yt7i,2023-11-30 18:50:28,"yep same as everyone else said: it’s awesome. i’m in trans-inclusive housing, and it’s so great— very tight knit community. 

there are also just tons of out trans students on campus. i can think of at least one trans person (besides me 🤭) in each of my classes— and i’m just talking about people literally wearing trans flag memorabilia. 

basically, the campus is crawling with us. you’d fit right in."

kbiicez,187yt7i,2023-11-30 21:49:42,"That's good to hear! If you don't mind me asking, how does the campus health center handle things like hrt? I know some UCs use informed consent while others don't - what about UCSC?"
kbis7s8,187yt7i,2023-11-30 23:42:23,"When I was there they had just recently rolled out their informed consent model which was back in 2019, so I assume it’s still going strong! I called to make an appointment and I had my Testosterone prescription about a week later. There was a case manager there too that ran a support group and they wrote me a letter for top surgery. If they’re still there I’m sure they still offer that for students who need it and I bet other therapists on campus do it too."
kbjt7gp,187yt7i,2023-12-01 06:26:07,Awesome - thanks!

kbn57n1,187yt7i,2023-12-01 20:02:14,"I am trans and I am pretty sure I would’ve never been able to come out if it wasn’t for the fact that I went to UCSC and got to live on campus and explore my gender identity there. I graduated earlier this year, and after 3 years living on campus and making tons of amazing friendships with wonderful, kind people, I miss it so much now that I’m not there anymore. Enjoy it while it lasts. It was the most accepting and intellectual place I have ever and probably will ever live. It’s definitely one of the best schools to go to if you’re a trans person! :)"

I called to make an appointment and I had my Testosterone prescription about a week later. There was a case manager there too that ran a support group and they wrote me a letter for top surgery. If they’re still there I’m sure they still offer that for students who need it and I bet other therapists on campus do it too."

kbphrkt,1890nkv,2023-12-02 10:04:13,"Dating in UCSC is very hit and miss. My best advice is to focus on yourself: focus on your classes, your health, and your hobbies. Show up for lectures, go to support/sections and talk with people there. Relationships can naturally form when you have something in common. If you enjoy going to the gym, go to the gym. If you enjoy going on walks, look for campus scheduled hikes & chat with people who go to those. This is the same for hobbies; if you like crocheting, go to the merrill lawn and crochet on a blanket (someone will undoubtedly see you & talk to you or maybe join you after some time). If you enjoy drawing or writing, go to a TWANAS or Fruitcake meeting to find like-minded people. Focus on yourself and the activities that you are interested in & the people will come to you in time. The key is that you have to go outside & enjoy your own company first"

Your frustration does make you come off as a bit desperate, and a little bit extreme. Just tone it down a notch. Focus on genuine relationships with people rather than looking for someone to set off the bomb that's ticking in your underpants.

kbj204w,1882die,2023-12-01 01:55:41,"I took 150 with Chris a year ago and really enjoyed it, great intro to networks, lectures were thorough and dense but I really liked her teaching style, made lectures interesting, emphasized the important stuff, and made it easy to understand. Def not an *easy* class but the grading felt lenient.

Only complaint was the building, classroom unit 1 is a nightmare lol"

In that regard it was fairly easy, but her exams are quite difficult and the homework can be time-consuming, so make sure you plan for that. Going to office hours and attending lab sessions is a good way to keep up with the material and prepare for the exams."
kc0pg8f,1882die,2023-12-04 14:59:14,"It's a good class, but Chris is very weird in how locked down she wants her material to be. She delists her Canvas course at the end of the quarter so I still have no clue what I got for my final project grade from last Winter lol. She values in person interactions so expect to go to class because she doesn't post lectures online (unless she changed from last year). I enjoyed the class but I already had a basic understanding of many of the networking topics and I've heard some people really struggled to understand some parts so be ready to study if you need it. Generally though, as long as you take notes in lecture and do the assignments you'll be good."

They are very busy and any impression that you can make on them now will help you greatly next year or after when you need letters.

kbgk9su,187sk85,2023-11-30 13:33:31,Highly recommend ^
kblkb9e,187sk85,2023-12-01 13:03:55,INTERESTING! Any idea how often this class repeats? I have finals in CC till 12/20. (Tagged CSGD Fall 24)
kbmmitk,187sk85,2023-12-01 17:33:44,You can take the class at any time at your own pace!
kbh1ixu,187sk85,2023-11-30 15:24:11,"Make sure you take the assignment report stage seriously. It helps you understand how your code will work before you actually write any code, and visualize the algorithms or control flow of the program. This honestly applies for any CS class – I think a lot of the time there’s an instinct to jump straight into writing code but it becomes so much easier if you draw everything out on paper beforehand so that when you write the code there’s focus put on the programming language instead of program design."
kbio6ps,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:53:08,this is the best tip out there. you HAVE to understand the assignment description and be able to draw out the problem you’re trying to solve. been doing this since 13s and it has helped me w programming ever since
kbilx4t,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:27:31,If there was more time to do the assignments I probably would have taken the reports more seriously or do them beforehand as I just tend to hammer things out then write about it after but I guess everybody works differently.
kblsc0x,187sk85,2023-12-01 13:55:31,I'm going to have to agree with this one. I never felt like I had enough time to really let things sink in and come up with a design. My better assignment scores came from when I just started implementing functions from day 1 and getting help right away when I couldn't resolve bugs.
kbgmi3h,187sk85,2023-11-30 13:47:14,"Go to section. TAs and Tutors are an incredible resource, don’t miss out on it. 
If you know people, form a study group but be very careful to never share your code with them.
A study group is a great way to understand the assignments conceptually."
kbi189s,187sk85,2023-11-30 19:30:12,Lots of praying 🙏🏻
kbilrb4,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:25:43,"Currently in it and I had to put my other classes on the backburner in order to deal with all the assignments and reports that come my way. If you have a background in C you'll probably do well but if not, all I can really say is start extremely early and hopefully you can slack off a little bit on your other classes as this is really a class that needs all your attention. Many of the assignments are time consuming and the assignment descriptions are pretty abstract sometimes so you need to be prepared to ask questions and work on it right when it comes out. I didn't go to sections as I fell behind but I've heard some others who got some good help on their assignments there. So make sure your schedule can accommodate the TA sections and office hours and you should be fine. That and you are taking other classes that aren't stressful."
kbinz4r,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:50:44,"start ASAP and go to office hours, this is a habit that’s important to build up because you will need it for all future CS classes. i recommend teaching yourself some C and at least having an idea of what a Makefile is and how to write it — this is a kinda random thing to mention but when I took 13 it was the first quarter he taught it and he didn’t give you makefiles nor teach us what a makefile was til week 7 even though we used it in assignments all quarter. anyway, make sure you’re comfortable with that Lol"
kbgdope,187sk85,2023-11-30 12:52:21,13s is all C programming so i would recommend  brushing up on your C programming and having a good foundation. Also use your TAs
kbjoixc,187sk85,2023-12-01 05:51:28,"I would say that the biggest down fall students have in these classes is time management.   


Evaluating a problem and coming up with a workable solution takes time.  


Putting that solution into workable code takes time.  


Testing that solution and resolving bugs takes time.  


There is always some student who wants to do short cuts. They want to start coding at the last minute but they never took time to evaluate the problem so they get stuck. Or they took time to evaluate the problem and code it out, but no time to test it or look for bugs, so they turn in something that fails half the tests.  


The way you resolve this is by showing up to every class and every section. This will ensure you're picking up all the tips and tricks and hints that you can, it will also allow you to talk with TAs and professor during Office Hours which is a huge resource.  


Make sure that you're reading your C book BEFORE class. You should know how the code works before you get to class. That way you can focus your thinking on algorithms rather than syntax.  


Start on assignments early. You get 2 weeks to do assignments, nearly all of them take about a week or more to complete for a new programmer. So if you're starting on day 6 or 7 then you're shooting yourself in the foot, especially if you're new."
kblrtu0,187sk85,2023-12-01 13:52:13,This is not the case for Veenstra. You get 1 week for assignments. We also had no reading list so there was no way to anticipate what was being lectured on a given day.
kbls0zk,187sk85,2023-12-01 13:53:31,Then start the day before
kbltmdt,187sk85,2023-12-01 14:03:55,"Start what before? The reading? If you don't know what to read and the class tends to jump around different sections, I'm not sure where you'd exactly start. I'd personally recommend reading the book before the class begins. It's not a terribly long read but it's doable. I wish I had done that personally."
kbmba1h,187sk85,2023-12-01 16:08:51,"Start your assignment the day before it’s released if your professor allows it

Get the pdfs from another student if need be


And as far as reading go you should be reading your entire C book on the first week… isn’t it like 50 pages long?"
kbkct6d,187sk85,2023-12-01 08:34:05,"My two cents as someone who did it very chaotically:
- As much as I am a hypocrite for saying this, start early. If you don't have the incentive to, just try to write for two minutes at the start of the week. If you figure out what to do, great! If not, go to the professor's office hours or a tutor's. 
- Consider reading the book. It's good practice to, at the very least, skin through the harder concepts like pointers.
- Just talk to people who've gotten through the class. You might find some sage advice that I can't think of."
kbl2s4h,187sk85,2023-12-01 11:13:07,"Get started on your assignments as soon as possible, that way you know what questions to ask your TA in sections.   
You can go to sections you are not enrolled in, very useful if you run into questions on the assignment after your section for the week.   
Use the Slack for the class if you have questions, even if it seems like a minor thing, you'd be surprised how many people might be running into the same problem as you.   
Be prepared to do extra work when your program fails to pass the autograder; pay very close attention to the error messages it gives, sometimes it might be as minor as forgetting to put an extra space in your printf statement. This is also why getting started early is important."
kbgp6ef,187sk85,2023-11-30 14:03:37,Start stuff early and if you have a question ask a tutor/TA. If you do that you will be fine.
kbiq515,187sk85,2023-11-30 23:16:27,You'll be fine I promise
kbnoeqx,187sk85,2023-12-01 23:20:41,"lots of good tips already mentioned. section and OH usually serve different purposes, so ideally you go to section every week and OH for more direct help. 

If you do go to professor/TA OH and it’s not too busy, you should ask if they’re willing to look at your reports and tell you how you can improve. dont underestimate how important doing those right is. 

always read the fine print!!!"
kc8muys,187sk85,2023-12-06 07:53:20,"Taking it this quarter. You should try understanding the programming assignment immediately after it's released and start thinking about the different components you will need to implement your solution effectively. 

However, I would actually give different advice from other people here and say that I wouldn't actually start coding until at least two days after the PDF is released because it's always riddled with mistakes and random little errors that will cause you immense frustration and waste your time for no reason; these always get fixed after a few days when the people who worked on it first realize all the mistakes that are present and the design document consequently gets updated.

The one other important thing is to heavily read/utilize the Discord/slack that is used for the class. People will ask and answer questions there, and the TAs are very active on it as well. This is probably the single most important feature that you should utilize in the class. I can honestly say that I would spend at least 3-4x longer on this class every week if I did not read our Slack chats thoroughly. 

Lastly, I'm going to have one more contrarian point here and say that I never went to a single lecture or section and I'm doing fine. I can't really speak for sections as they're all unique and whether or not they're helpful is kind of random and a matter of luck. However, I don't think the lectures really help at all with the assignments bc everybody seems to be starting from square one on any given PA just from reading the slack chats. You're definitely going to be learning all of the necessary info by yourself just from your own research, so you might find it helpful to just skip lectures altogether and instead utilize that time to learn on your own."

kbmmitk,187sk85,2023-12-01 17:33:44,You can take the class at any time at your own pace!
kbio6ps,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:53:08,this is the best tip out there. you HAVE to understand the assignment description and be able to draw out the problem you’re trying to solve. been doing this since 13s and it has helped me w programming ever since
kbilx4t,187sk85,2023-11-30 22:27:31,If there was more time to do the assignments I probably would have taken the reports more seriously or do them beforehand as I just tend to hammer things out then write about it after but I guess everybody works differently.
kblsc0x,187sk85,2023-12-01 13:55:31,I'm going to have to agree with this one. I never felt like I had enough time to really let things sink in and come up with a design.

kbdf1go,1879xx7,2023-11-29 22:20:08,"No, don't take ece103 with ece118. In ECE118, people spend their nights in the lab. If you want to learn, I will suggest not to take 103 with 118. 118 is crazy. I took this class before and I didn't really have a good time especially to some teammate issues. It's a good class though. However, if you want to pass both classes, you can do so and you are likely to pass both, especially 118. But the grades will likely be miserable ngl lol"
kbdnmth,1879xx7,2023-11-30 00:03:24,"I know people that have taken ECE 118. They basically lived in the lab for the quarter, the class should be 12 credits with the workload they get."
kbddiwb,1879xx7,2023-11-29 22:03:41,"ECE 118 (mechatronics) is, deservedly, a 10-unit course, averaging about 30 hours a week (less in the first few weeks, more in the last few).

ECE 103 (signals and systems) is a fairly straightforward math course, but absolutely essential fundamentals for signal processing.  You can't afford to blow of this course, but it should be doable alongside ECE 118."
kbdqjzb,1879xx7,2023-11-30 00:42:00,"Doable, last spring I took 118 with two more major classes. Didnt do great but still passed,  lost a lot of sleep and social life. 118 and 103 should be fine if you’re only taking those two classes for spring.

 I’d recommend completing 103 assignments as soon as you can and then spend the rest of your available time doing 118. I’d also recommend setting a weekly schedule with your partners where you’re both physically in the lab.

Best of luck, 118 is tough but a ton of fun."
kbhxi68,1879xx7,2023-11-30 19:04:02,"I mean it’s doable but you’ll basically have no free time or social life lol. ECE 118 will absolutely take most of your time so like others have said you will most likely have to blow off 103. I advise against it if you are passionate about signal processing and communication as this is a fundamental course and you probably won’t learn too much if you do those two courses together. Side note, it’s not the end of the world if you have to do one or two extra quarters. That’s a pretty common thing for ECE and robotic majors due to the high class load."
kb9bk0r,186ltiv,2023-11-29 05:33:58,"A man followed me for blocks, downtown, but did more than follow, kept running in front of me, telling me he was a cop, actively trying to change my path. Then he appeared on a bike, again in front of me, around me. I ended up walking in the street, thought a driver might see the situation and stop, bring reinforcements. No such luck. Told the guy, I'm calling the police. This did nothing. Called the police. They arrived in 1 minute and the guy literally dove in bushes. Three cop cars came and, couldn't find him. While I'm talking to the police, i see this differently dressed guy in my peripheral view, walking to pick up the bike, he chucked by the bushes, carrying an amazon package. It was him. Cops had him sit on the curb so I could walk the rest of my route home. My goal was to not let that guy know where I stay. Exciting times for a single person walking in downtown Santa Cruz."

It's not uncommon to be harassed by some junky bum, unfortunately. It's particularly risky during the week in the off season when downtown is not very busy. It's best to go with someone, especially at night. 

Most of the time they're somewhat harmless, just nuts, but I'd recommend you get pepper spray or even better a stun gun (not a cheap little taser, but an actual stun gun that shoots the prongs, similar to what cops have)."

kb9ukl1,186ltiv,2023-11-29 07:46:11,">from the forever 21/new leaf market area all the way down until i actually got on a bus that takes me to ucsc

That sounds scary, and that 1.5 block stretch passes New Leaf market and the Downtown information kiosk.  If ever you feel unsafe you can go I to either of those establishments and ask for help;  the information kiosk has had the same person working it most days for at least 5 years and there is a security guard inside New Leaf who will help.  People who work and live Downtown will either recognize the joker and know how to handle them or will ID them to get the police involved either then or at a later time if they take off. 

You can also stand your ground, look them in the eye, and ask in a loud, assertive voice, ""Are you following me? Stop following me!""

I've lived Downtown for over 20 years, walk there often, and have never felt unsafe. I'm a male and I get that this might be a factor in our different experiences (which frankly sucks and isn't fair) but I promise you that all the store proprietors do not want you to feel unsafe and will help if you ask.


edit:  to clarify, what I mean by raising one's voice is not to get in their face and challenge them, but more to do so at a distance to generate attention.  OP said this was in broad daylight with people around and my idea was to change the power dynamic, throw them off, and solicit help in one action.  Wouldn't recommend this at night or in an otherwise empty street."

kbae04g,186ltiv,2023-11-29 09:42:27,The problem is that a lot of these street people are mentally unstable so it's very hard to predict how they'll react. Some might run away but a few might get aggressive back.

Not to co-opt either but

I want to remind y'all that if there were adequate resources for addicts, this wouldn't be nearly as severe of a problem...everyone complaining about the homeless didn't care when they were out of sight, and the only people to blame for moving them out of encampments is the ✨cops✨"
kbb64ge,186ltiv,2023-11-29 12:30:20,"I absolutely agree with you on that, and Santa Cruz does have some pretty amazing resources for people experiencing homelessness (homeless persons health project for instance) but I still think it has to be acknowledged that there are some shitty, malicious people living on the street that would be genuinely dangerous no matter how many services were provided."
kbbj5gu,186ltiv,2023-11-29 13:49:54,"For a small sub-set of the homeless population that is true. Unfortunately, many do not want housing or rules of any kind, and will do pretty much anything to get what they want/need, including property crime and/or violent assault. If you don’t recognize that then you are part of the problem."
kbbrvuh,186ltiv,2023-11-29 14:45:14,"I recognize that they likely need mental health care. I promise you no one down there likes sleeping in the rain while they forcibly detox from drugs due to addiction and poverty. No one is just naturally violent and vicious. And even if they are, they need HELP."
kbmc2bi,186ltiv,2023-12-01 16:14:43,"Few if any communities offer more help/services than ours, but most of that help comes with rules that many are unwilling to comply with. This is a feature, not a glitch, and allowing people to set up camp wherever and whenever they want provides them neither compassion nor dignity. We all need to do better, but that doesn’t mean we have to accept criminal behavior, much less that such acceptance should be seen as a form of HELP."
kbn4q3x,186ltiv,2023-12-01 19:58:03,I don't think that forcing a person to enter drug counseling and quit using as a REQUIREMENT for consistent housing is ethical 🤷🏻‍♀️
kbnh59l,186ltiv,2023-12-01 21:53:49,"Even when that housing is subsidized/free? Is your position that there should be no accountability for people receiving services/housing, and that it’s better/more humane/compassionate/dignified to just give someone a tent, needles, and maybe a porta-potty so they can slowly decay/tranq themselves to death? Or maybe you think pimping out people, storing guns, ammunition, cash, possessing narcotics for sale, possessing stolen property in the encampments, or even setting fire to the landscape is all preferable to having a few rules? Does that seem like effective public policy?"
kbnhg3n,186ltiv,2023-12-01 21:57:06,I believe in intensive public health policy like safe use sites and free drug testing. I believe in social reform that emphasizes destigmatizing homelessness. I believe that people who are addicted to drugs and who are unhoused are not going to automatically comply with a system they've been literally fighting against. Why the hell would you want to follow the city's rules when they're the ones who have been ripping your house out from under you? Compassionate socialization and the destigmatizing of drug use and drug moderation saves lives. That's all.
kbozxvl,186ltiv,2023-12-02 08:03:17,"That sounds like a ‘yes.” Like so many others, you say so much about what we shouldn’t do, with little to no prescription for what should be done, let alone any evidence of whether those prescriptions actually work or  improve anyone’s circumstances. A tent stocked with needles and Narcan just doesn’t seem compelling to me."
kbetu9k,186ltiv,2023-11-30 07:12:55,"As long as access to drugs and benefits with little to no requirements for self-improvement and no consequences for anti-social behavior exist here homelessness will remain a problem. If we start offering free housing and addiction services with no strings attached, it will only get worse."
kbf15m8,186ltiv,2023-11-30 07:59:14,"I didn't say my idea was to give them ""drugs and benefits with no requirements for self improvement""

These people need intensive mental health services. They need to not be constantly exposed to the elements. They need what we all need: consistent healthcare and the stability of having a bed every night."
kbf1rau,186ltiv,2023-11-30 08:03:01,gonna upvote you for your empathy (which is beautiful) and caution you that some folks really do just want to watch the world burn.
kbf2raf,186ltiv,2023-11-30 08:09:12,"And even they don't deserve to rot on the streets. We have a whole federalized mental institution system in this country. If they're such a danger to us all, why aren't they receiving the kind of help THEY need.

When we think of mental health services, a lot of us think of a therapist and an outpatient system. If there are people being physically violent and harassing others, the kind of mental health care they need is not gentle outpatient. No one in the world is a terrifying person just because. They've been changed by something, whether it be trauma or drugs or anger. But all of those things are problems with solutions."

This breaks down how the actual numbers prove that jailing and imprisoning people with serious mental illnesses is actually more expensive than treating them in a psychiatric facility on a short-term basis. Psychotropic drugs and outpatient therapeutic methods have evolved exponentially in the last 25 years, and we absolutely have the ability to help these people. Our legislators just don't want to put the money there."

You guys cannot seriously allow drugged out crack heads to get over on you and make you feel uncomfortable. You need to get loud, carry some pepper spray , call the cops, take a self defense class, do anything to prevent yourself from walking around like a big easy ass target."
kbaxm84,186ltiv,2023-11-29 11:39:25,"Right. The first thing I learned as a single woman living in downtown Los Angeles is to ""walk with purpose"".

kbtuqxc,186ltiv,2023-12-03 08:26:02,I see your point but I called non emergency because I was physically fine just emotionally rattled. She was so whacked out she barely landed the punch and I had to go to work. I wasn’t going to stick around and wait for them to wander the streets looking for her or to come talk to me. I just wanted it reported in case they took it upon themselves to go look for her to keep her away from others.
kbuk2xb,186ltiv,2023-12-03 10:59:53,well that makes sense.. that's probably why they were less than concerned..
kbunfm7,186ltiv,2023-12-03 11:19:44,I think it’s more that they just deal with all the time. Once I said I didn’t need an ambulance that was pretty much it.
kb9x2bk,186ltiv,2023-11-29 08:01:29,I’m sorry this happened to you! Usually not a good idea to go home if someone’s following you. It’s better to call for help or stay somewhere you feel safe until they leave
kbc49ax,186ltiv,2023-11-29 16:10:15,"ugh im sorry :( I lived downtown for two years and felt like I was getting harassed constantly.
I started skating everywhere so I was faster and it was harder to follow me, I would call my bf or my mom (could even facetime and show the guy behind you) and also started keeping my pepper spray visible, that all seemed to help."
kbmmfo1,186ltiv,2023-12-01 17:33:04,"I don't know if it works and haven't done any research but I always heard that if you scream at them they leave. By scream I mean like yell at the top of your lungs stay the f*** away from me or something to that tune. It is supposed to be jarring and scare them off. I could be totally wrong or off base. Not really looking to argue on it. These people are trying to prey on the weak and they are usually cowards. If you yell and attact a bunch of attention, they may just faulter or leave you alone. Obviously, I'm making sure you keep distance and contact police. Being in a spot with other people might help. There are also situations like if you are approached at a gas station at night where one person is actually trying to distract you while another approaches from behind. So keeping a good awareness of your surroundings in these cases is good too. These are the things I was told at least when I was growing up. Not sure how applicable any of it is. The main thing is it is better to be safe than sorry."

Why the hell would you want to follow the city's rules when they're the ones who have been ripping your house out from under you? Compassionate socialization and the destigmatizing of drug use and drug moderation saves lives. That's all.

kbetu9k,186ltiv,2023-11-30 07:12:55,"As long as access to drugs and benefits with little to no requirements for self-improvement and no consequences for anti-social behavior exist here homelessness will remain a problem.

I just wanted it reported in case they took it upon themselves to go look for her to keep her away from others.

kayckb3,184xrb1,2023-11-27 01:01:20,??? How would they know we’re stoners when they admit us? I just became one once I got here lol
kayd3we,184xrb1,2023-11-27 01:08:51,you must’ve missed it on the UC app
kazqog9,184xrb1,2023-11-27 08:44:42,You didn’t have to take the entry rolling exam?
kb0i5mt,184xrb1,2023-11-27 11:33:07,It's called Rolling Admission for a reason.
kayalrn,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:34:11,There are a lot of stoners but I never smoked and had a good time. There’s definitely groups of people who do more than just smoke or not smoke at all
kayft4p,184xrb1,2023-11-27 01:46:33,When I went there in the late 90’s my dad came to visit and brought the latest Rolling Stone magazine that had a cover story about UCSC being “the most stoned college in America”.  Think my dad was actually proud of that. 😂

kaza4vo,184xrb1,2023-11-27 06:52:26,"There are stoners at every good school. Especially in states where it’s legal. But my impression is that all of the UCs have become super STEM-oriented, and a lot more competitive than they used to be. 
If anything, UCSC could be re-labeled UC Silicon Valley. 
You’ll find your people wherever you end up. With almost 20,000 students at UCSC, you should be just fine being a non-stoner with more than plenty of non-stoning likeminded people."
kazy8wr,184xrb1,2023-11-27 09:31:22,"I feel like it's not stoners go to UCSC but is more students become stoners after going to UCSC (i.e. in my experience, everyone to some extent smoked weed, even the nerds! you don't have to and for the most part, people tend to be respectful of your boundaries, it's just so ingrained within the culture almost everyone does it)"
kayanlm,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:34:52,"Sorry, having to roll a fat doing is part of the entry placements, looks like this isn’t the school for you"
kb02n0j,184xrb1,2023-11-27 09:58:10,"I have not once smoked weed or done drugs, and the only form of alcohol my body can tolerate is spiked lemonade. I am a senior at UCSC, so they accept non-stoners too. I have taken a single edible and it did nothing for me."
kbior7h,184xrb1,2023-11-30 22:59:44,Spiked lemonade is popular with skaters
kbipf9n,184xrb1,2023-11-30 23:07:45,"But, did you find the population of the school to be more weed oriented than regular academic society?  OP hasn’t really had the question answered.  

It takes twice for an effect, BTW"
kbiy9h6,184xrb1,2023-12-01 01:03:22,"I’d say no, or it’s slightly more than average. Idk, my first roommate here was a mushroom smuggler."
kb0do6m,184xrb1,2023-11-27 11:05:43,"In my experience the venn diagram of stoners and nerds at UCSC is practically a circle 

You'll be fine, I knew lots of people who didn't smoke weed and it wasn't a big deal"
kb0kdrm,184xrb1,2023-11-27 11:46:36,"that’s a giant stereotype but somehow none of my friends and none of my boyfriends friends smoke. in fact that despise smoking and think it kills brains cells. so i think it’s the same as most schools, you’ll find people who smoke/drink if that’s what you are in to. and you can easily stay away from it"
kay7xws,184xrb1,2023-11-26 23:58:38,Depends on what your idea of a good time is. It's very much a stoner school.
kay7zcf,184xrb1,2023-11-26 23:59:11,"I’m down to do anything just not down to take a joint.

Are there people at the school who don’t for the archetype, or not really?"
kay81m3,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:00:02,You'll be fine
kay82qh,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:00:27,"lol, i hope 🤞"
kay867d,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:01:42,"I don't smoke either. The pressure is there at times because of the culture, but it's not hard to say no, and no one will force it on you. At least in my experience."
kay87y9,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:02:21,That’s good. good to hear that it’s not a deal breaker from what it seems.
kayekjo,184xrb1,2023-11-27 01:29:14,Yeah nobody cares lol it's just weed. Do it or don't it doesn't matter at all
kay8kyi,184xrb1,2023-11-27 00:07:05,"lol you’re chilling none of my friends smoke, it’s really not that big of a deal once you’re on campus although you might smell it sometimes"
kazjjro,184xrb1,2023-11-27 07:58:49,"if you can’t stand the smell of weed, it might not be the best place for you. if you can tolerate it then you’re fine. it doesn’t always smell but you’ll smell it frequently enough"
kb16zwb,184xrb1,2023-11-27 14:04:01,"You'll find your place here! I'm not a stoner, but I've been having an amazing experience. The ones who do use weed here are super sweet, and they're very respectful of your space and comfort. You'll be fine. :}"
kazj53f,184xrb1,2023-11-27 07:56:07,"I don’t smoke and I’m pretty nerdy cs major but many nerdy stem majors that you would never expect to be stoners actually are 🤣 doesn’t bother me though just surprises me lol but I think pretty much everyone has tried it at least, and if you’re not into it there’s not really any peer pressure (in my experience) i think you’ll be fine"
kb14dc8,184xrb1,2023-11-27 13:48:05,"Lmao we all smoke pot and do our homework together, you'll be fine. People who still see cannabis and academia as opposite fields aren't smoking the right weed 😂"
kb2kecu,184xrb1,2023-11-27 19:35:54,People are realizing that weed really isn't as cool as it's cracked up to be. Nobody pressures you to do it and people just usually do it on their own and with their friends who are also into it. It's no more of a stoner school than any other school
kbg3hlh,184xrb1,2023-11-30 11:50:37,Why would you even ask this💀💀
kb04l0m,184xrb1,2023-11-27 10:10:20,"UCSC is one of the top public schools for engineering degrees. Stoners can be nerds, too. 

And I know this is a crazy thought, but there are even some people who smoke weed who don't make it their entire identity and lead very successful, nerdy lives."
kb06s4d,184xrb1,2023-11-27 10:23:53,You may not be a stoner when you get accepted but you'll graduate a stoner whether you like it or not
kb0e59y,184xrb1,2023-11-27 11:08:37,"Apply to Crown College in your housing App and you'll be amongst the fellow nerds. 

Like most things in life - generalizations tend to gloss over the wide range of experiences out there. Santa Cruz has a stoner culture generally, being a beach town that's vibed with the culture over the years. But it's not a monolithic thing. Personally I smoked maybe 5-10 times total in my 4 years there, but found my group in more generic house parties and other social get to gethers (sports, beach time, etc.). 

Keep up with your hobbies and when you get to campus look out for opportunities to participate in social functions focused on those hobbies. You'll find them."
kb0megw,184xrb1,2023-11-27 11:58:43,This gets asked every year and its just as cringe every time
kb0bjhj,184xrb1,2023-11-27 10:52:54,"I went in the early 10s, and there was a huge amount of diversity. My only recommendation is to apply for a college other than Porter or Kresge, because they tend to have the higher proportions of the stereotypical stoner/druggie students than other colleges. Even if you end up there, you'll be fine and find your people. UCSC is a wonderful school! Good on you for wanting to apply there :)"
kb1824k,184xrb1,2023-11-27 14:10:31,Legal everywhere in CA now - this does not seem like a real question.

kb1oqvs,184xrb1,2023-11-27 15:59:11,They don’t do drug tests lmfao just do ur work man you’ll be fine

kb7vsux,184xrb1,2023-11-28 20:08:49,"So because of that reputation they actually now are starting to administer drug test to students who live on campus, jk 


But being a UC they receive finding from the federal government, who still classified that drug as illegal. So school policy I'm order to receive funding if you're caught smoking or in possession as a student they will need to take disciplinary action. 
So keep that in mind"

CSE103 is pretty straightforward; attending the lectures, as well as the review lectures, and doing the homework prepares you for the exams well. For CSE180, all the assignments any tests build off of the same schema, although the specifics are different every year. The labs are worth 0% of the grade due to prof’s concerns with ChatGPT. CSE187 is a group project course where you learn how to use React with NextJS, APIS in Swagger and GraphQL, Postgres databases, and containerization with Docker to build an microservice-oriented ecommerce app. That course is being offered in Spring. I took CSE130 in Spring 2023 with Veenstra and it was pretty easy, although I heard the class has gotten a bit harder judging by the recent Reddit posts (Taylor Swift go brrrr).

kaxu2rb,184sval,2023-11-26 21:19:15,Its not that hard of a class. The assignments/exams/quizzes are pretty well structured and are all based off what you learn in class. I would say its easier than 101 Tantalo

katocr3,1847r1x,2023-11-26 03:42:02,"Your best bet in taking a closed class is to beg the professor for a permission code. I don't quite remember if this is able to force you past the 19 credit limit so I apologize. 

In terms of the class you're wanting to take, I would say there's a slim chance you might get one since the Psych department is super impacted meaning probably hundreds of other students e-mailing the professor for one as well."
kaum8af,1847r1x,2023-11-26 08:27:38,"for overloading, ive filled up a form which they sent. and the response will only come after the end of fall. So once i get that I would need the permission code to enroll when winter quarter starts like you said. 

Wow Didnt know Psych would receive such demand. Will try to keep my options open in that case!

Thank you so much!"

kase5gv,183wxmx,2023-11-25 19:10:08,"i have a friend who is undeclared—her experience is that it was easy to experiment with intro classes her frosh fall quarter, but after that she was running into problems seeking advice from advisors who wanted her to pick a major before she was able to plan further GEs and study abroad plans. i don’t see harm in doing it if you have some idea of what you want to do and know that taking an array of intro classes freshman fall quarter will help you decide"
kase7x5,183wxmx,2023-11-25 19:10:38,it’s also very easy to switch majors before you start classes—i applied as one major and literally just clicked a button to switch my major over the summer
karrh81,183wxmx,2023-11-25 16:26:05,I believe you cannot declare Computer Science after being undeclared--you have to be admitted as a proposed CS major. [See the Computer Science B.A. page for details](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/current/general-catalog/academic-units/baskin-engineering/computer-science-and-engineering/computer-science-ba/). Someone please correct me if I am wrong!

kas930e,183wxmx,2023-11-25 18:32:05,"UCSC admits by major only in the College of Engineering. For other majors outside the Engineering College, applicants are admitted into a “proposed” major but are free to pursue any major as long as they take the required pre-req courses to declare."
kat3cak,183wxmx,2023-11-25 23:03:05,"It's still ""proposed"" in Baskin Engineering. You can only ""declare"" after you have finished passing your prerequisites with the specified GPA just like all the other majors. You also have the choice to change your ""proposed"" major and take other major prereq classes. The only thing is that you can never change into Computer Science cause it is ""impacted""."
kau4qjh,183wxmx,2023-11-26 06:25:29,"Yes, your a still in a proposed major in Baskin but you are guaranteed a major in the College of Engineering if you are admitted as a Freshman with the exception of CS where you need a direct admit into the proposed major. Students outside Baskin cannot switch into the Engineering college unless they are admitted as Freshman or a Transfer. ."
kaso24s,183wxmx,2023-11-25 20:27:36,"My experience with ucsc as someone who came in undeclared, was that once I knew what I wanted to declare major departments were slow to respond to emails and gave me contradictory advice, ultimately I got into my desired major but it was after a lot of hair pulling and email chains ( plus taking a few unnecessary classes). So if you know what you want, or have a general sense just declare it and you can always switch later."

kar32tt,183t5yp,2023-11-25 13:49:25,I did DoorDash during my first year at UCSC. It was pretty good income. A way I got around the waitlist was put my primary area in a different zip code. You can still dash in whatever area you’re in.

kase4r1,183vpum,2023-11-25 19:09:59,My son was a transfer last year and had disability accomodations and had a single in porter. However they don't guarantee housing for the  second year after transfer. He did apply for housing but by the time you find out about it it's kind of late (he did get approved). So you may worry that you won't get it and want to look for an apartment.
kau1ayv,183vpum,2023-11-26 05:57:26,"Max out everything you can get via DRC (disability resource ctr). I didn’t while I was there and totally regret it. The other suggestions re EOP are good, but def take advantage of whatever ur disability affords you from DRC"

I think I left her a good rmp review and since she's knew ish I think it's one of the few reviews so u can check that out too. she's a very knowledgeable and intriguing person. idk how she is for upper div cuz I took his 5c with her but absolutely adored and always looked forward to her class."

However, I feel so sorry for the non-history majors who took her for 5c thinking they were getting an easy bible class.  I found her grading to be very inconsistent and ended up taking my first ever P/NP grading option b/c I didn't want to deal with unknowns.

Pourmand is very much focused on his research, and you could tell his lectures were thrown together without much thought or care. The class was structured well though, and Nader is a nice guy. I'd say if you have the interest, it's worth taking his class. But without a drive to explore the material yourself, you won't get much out of his classes"

I am stuck on the Dilemma part; that's why I need some clarity. People have mixed reactions about it, which is confusing for me. I reached out to people on Linked In, which is such a waste. Thats why I thought Reddit would be a better platform."

i dont got the acceptance rate or any of that. as LostQuestionsss put it, your sources on google would be as solid as mine, and tbh, id probably recommend against applying to this school. the city itself is expensive and resistant to changing for the uni. the cs and math programs are solid but cs is impacted to shit. (i meant to be a cs major myself, but ended up applying and graduating b.s. pure math. that being said i learned a ton that i ended up applying to my cs journey. )  

also idk the level of familiarity you have with cs, but these cs majors go super low level. like, these cs majors edge comp engineering from the sound of it. if going cs doesnt pan out, id def suggest applied math. 

if the city doesn't sway you, if the ms cs acceptance rates look reasonable to you, and the content of the cs undergrad courses doesn't sway you, i think you should apply. if im interpreting your GPA correctly, youd probably get it."

kajghhj,182ldef,2023-11-23 23:17:30,"XPS is solid if you want to splurge. Framework might be worth looking into as well since you'd probably be interested in that sort of thing. HPs are good on the cheaper end. Lenovo will also often have class leading specs for the price range. Something running AMD silicon would probably be best as they tend to be more efficient than Intel machines. Ryzen 5 should be more than enough power to do anything you'll need it to, and performance wise, it should last longer than your degree will take to complete. Avoid Apple devices as their processors tend to have issues with virtual machines and some of the other software we use. Nothing with less than 16gb of ram, and ideally 32gb or more. You shouldn't need a GPU for anything unless you take any machine learning classes as an elective, and even then, i'm not sure if it would be necessary. I'd recommend getting something around 16 inches as the extra screen space will help your workflow. Storage will depend on whether you have any other computers or not. I use Dropbox so I don't save anything locally. If you are planning on using it as your only device, I'd recommend 1tb to be comfortable. If you have a desktop or some other way of storing files, then you can get away with 250-500gb. Anything more is unnecessary.

I'm running an older HP envy that I picked up used for $300 on Marketplace because its last owner spilled coffee on it. I cleaned up the keyboard, and it's been a solid performer ever since. I'm currently in the process of replacing it with the Framework 16, which I have pre-ordered."

Use Linux for everything except some of the crappy ""industry-standard"" software that is so old and flakey that it can only be run on Windows.

Doing that would probably get you a better laptop and would last you MUCH longer than a retail one in that price range. Refurbished laptops are usually almost at or the same quality as when they were sold initially, as long as you do your research on what you're getting. MSRP purchases at 500-1k are probably going to be worse, because in order to bring a device to that range and still net profit companies skip on out certain hardware that really shouldn't be cheaped out on, and from my experience of repairing people's stuff these problems will quickly show itself a few months to a year max down the line. It's not the end of the world and there are still ok stuff to get at $500 from the local bestbuy, but I still recommend at least searching the secondhand market for a bit, you might be pleasantly surprised on what you can get instead; and even more shocked about the quality. 

In response to a few suggestions from other comments suggesting a framework device, I have one and my experience is mixed. Since you're also CE if you do decide to get a FW you should be fine tho cuz the newer models are much more stable, but don't expect the best battery life in any case."
kajh562,182ldef,2023-11-23 23:25:48,i have an xps and adore it as a ce major!
kajir5b,182ldef,2023-11-23 23:46:42,"Fellow computer engineering freshman here, I have the ASUS zephyrus g15 and I love it. It's a bit expensive but it's basically the perfect laptop for me as I game also. If you're looking for cheaper the Dell XPS is a decent choice. If you're into upgrade ability framework is probably the best laptop for future proofing on the market right now."

kallqqe,182ldef,2023-11-24 11:16:20,"Ya but the thing is that one class lasts for like 2 months and is prolly one of the most annoying classes, sure there is a lab full of windows based computers, but I’m pretty sure there are more than 30 something students in that class that needs those computers too… Also imagine stressing out because you can’t use one of the lab computers and you have a Mac which won’t work for the labs, and the due date is coming up which you can’t fail because if u fail a lab u fail the class. Like I’m just saying that it’s prolly better to have a windows just to save you future stress.

kamyh3t,182ldef,2023-11-24 16:58:28,"I tutor CSE 100. You probably already know this, but for others that dont know, the way the class is setup is that during your section, you will always have a seat available for you. Sections are twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday. Apart from those times, the lab is never full to the point that you need to wait for a computer. Plus the labs are open 24/7, meaning that you can access them at any time. 

I honestly think Mac is better than Windows based computers for CE, except if you are taking one of the heavy hardware concentrations which might require you to download some circuit building software for some classes. The underline Unix system on Macs are just far superior, and most of the time runs right out of the box."
