I have emailed a handful of them beforehand but they’ve yet to reply and I’ve already missed one of my lectures. Does the uni in of itself offer any sorts of policies in this regard that, like in the case of COVID, would allow me miss a few days to quarantine without taking a massive hit to my grade?

I really feel for these people because that is how I felt halfway thru my first quarter last year as a transfer student.

I'm a non-traditional student (25+ yr old), who hasn't experienced a full life, but has experienced enough to know that the grass is always greener on the other side. That's the human mind that has been conditioned to constantly project itself into a future scenario that will surely bring fulfillment. It's *that school*, or *that relationship*, or *that job*, that will bring lasting satisfaction. Spoiler alert, it's not. Don't become like the majority of our society that thinks it's the next big thing that will make you happy. I sure was guilty of this when I set many expectations for what ucsc would be like.

Truth is, you can go to any school Reddit page and find dozens of students who lament on how awful their school is and how they regret going there. I'm serious, look for yourself. Go to the reddit pages of Cal, SJSU, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, CSULB, CSUF, etc, and search for the key words ""lonely"", ""no friends"", ""regret"", and ""depressed"". How is it that students from all these different universities with no affiliation are having the same negative experiences?? This is a topic that can be talked about at length, but I think it stems from several things i.e. social media, societal factors mentioned previously, lack of purpose, lack of spirituality, and a lack of responsibility.

I'm not selling you anything here. The one thing I want to impart on my fellow classmates is that you have a choice in a only a few things in life, and that's it. You have choice in your response to external events, in your attitude, and in your perception of circumstances. Learn to see what you have control over and what you don't and your life will change drastically and almost immediately. Take it from a student who was in community college for 6 years and who took 8 years to transfer. Enough credits to have a B.S., 11 withdrawals, several failed classes, several different SSRIs and psych meds, a few years of heroin/fentanyl addiction, homelessness, and living in halfway houses.

Also PTSD, but no meds. I started to recognize them when they first came on. I said to myself, “you’re not dying, you’ve been thru this before and you know what it is”. Mine manifested in heart attacks, but obviously, I never had a heart attack nor died. Remind yourself right now that despite feeling like dying, you never have (I’m assuming, ha). Over time, just recognizing that overwhelming feeling of impending doom washing over you and then telling yourself, i know what this is, I’m not going to die and breathing and letting it pass thru you worked for me. “This is a panic attack. I’ve felt it before and lived thru it every time. I’m not going to die and it will be over soon.” Experts might say that this is ridiculous advice, but it worked for me. I had an attack driving in traffic once with my whole family in the car and managed to not wreck the car, which was an accomplishment. I also haven’t had one in more than 12 years after adopting this strategy. Maybe you can start this process once you start feeling Deja vu and tell yourself, “hey, I know what’s coming next”. \n\nI hope something eventually works for you; real panic attacks suck.

Life insurance serves as a crucial financial tool that provides protection and peace of mind for you and your loved ones.

1.Financial Protection for Dependents:

If you have dependents, such as a spouse, children, or aging parents, life insurance ensures they are financially protected in case of your unexpected death. The death benefit can help replace lost income, cover living expenses, and maintain their quality of life. #lifeinsurance #lifeinsurance #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsurancepolicy #lifeinsurancebroker #lifeinsurancematters #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsuranceagents #lifeinsurancematters #ffl

I thought feminist women hated men, but it turns out feminism benefits us all in the long run. Feminism is about fighting for equality for everyone. Just think of this class as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Because that’s what intersectional feminism does. It provides a set of mental tools to analyze and resist inequality.\n\nWhat I learned in that intro feminism class is what allowed me to better understand myself enough so that I could eventually begin to transition. Thankfully, at UCSC, feminism is almost always intersectional, so definitely stay in it. 🙂👍🏼 \n\nIntersectional feminism is about promoting a world where people are free to flourish into their own authentic, unique selves, independent of rigid binary gender roles. \n\nPeople are skeptical of feminism because the dominant narrative in society is that feminism is anti-male. While it is true that some feminist women are unironically misandrist, they shouldn’t be used to smear the rest of us good intersectional positive feminists. Most feminist women are pretty chill once you get to know them. They just want equal rights. \n\nAlso, I found the initial readings that we were assigned in my intro feminism class to be very hard to follow because it was packed with feminist terminology and feminist theories I hadn’t been educated on yet. Maybe this is why you want to drop the class. If so, just give it another week and see if the concepts start making sense. It seems intimidating at first, but just hang in there and try your best.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is up to you, but just remember, classes like this are intimidating because they require the mental courage to deconstruct your own identities.', 'Interesting how?

Also, you won't take any neuro classes until your third year because there are so many prereqs.\n\nThe best thing you can do is plan out your schedule early so you can see what your four years will look like. you can also add the double major later, and focus on CE for now while taking a couple of neuro pre-reqs on the side to see if it is a good fit. I'm actually in my fourth year just now declaring neuro so there is definitely time to figure things out."", 'You could maybe try physics. Physicists often work in the computational side of neuroscience and probably has more over lab with ur CE curriculum', 'You should do physics and neuroscience', 'Bruh', ""i mean it's def doable in 3-4 years but also keep in mind that the neuro degree is just an mcd bio degree + neuroscience elective classes. I'm also curious what parts of neuroscience interest you if you don't mind""]"

Now, I just think of how out of shape my calves are, and that I'm bringing a headlight the next non-MLK Monday.\n\nAfter 8:30pm, most lots can be parked in without permits. After I think 4:30, R permits can park at Hahn Student Services, and NC can park in several places. Then you don't have to walk as far.

As a prospective student, I have some questions mainly to help me prepare for my housing situation. The next 3 paragraphs will consist of me providing background and what I plan to do. 

Just to give an idea of where I’m at financially, I expect to have around $65,000-$70,000 by the time I start. I also have no debt.

I hope to live alone on campus (potentially with a roommate off campus), and just pay rent. Based on SC apartment prices, I don’t think I can afford to live alone.

For tuition, I’ll very likely use loans and be either a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant to offload some of that cost. In addition, I’m also planning to be aggressive with summer internships after my first year in order to gain valuable experience and obviously make some extra money. STEM internships seem to pay well, so I am hopeful.

In terms of housing, how difficult is it to get housing on campus? How about off campus? I prefer to have a single, or live in an apartment/house with a roommate, where we have separate rooms. If it’s relevant, the most I’m willing to spend is $1,500 per month.

I saw that The Graduate Apartments are within my budget, so if anyone has any experience there, please do share as much as you are comfortable with.

No sunlight really gets in there because it’s basically in a ditch. No stoves in the quads so if your quad isn’t close to the village kitchen then it’s a little bit of a walk. ~14 people per quad. With so many people the fridge and freezer can get cluttered if your roommates are messy. Walls are thin.

When I look back on classes I’ve taken, everything just feels like a fever dream. My notes are just a bunch of equations with zero context. Every time I try to learn a new concept, there’s always a couple very niche calculus proofs you need to do or some other background information which a whole other class could be dedicated to, but it’s all just glossed over. 


I’ve also been doing research during this time and have used nothing that I have learned in class for my research. I honestly have no idea wtf any of my classes are for. I’m glad we went over how to solve the time independent Schrödinger equation for a free particle, but what the actual hell do I need this for and in what context is this happening in besides very specific circumstances in a lab? Nothing I have learned seems practical, and if it is practical then the department is very good at keeping that information secret. I’m glad I know how to analyze a dielectric inside an electric field, but to be honest if you were to ask me if a material is a dialectic or not I’d be fucking stumped. And if you were to ask me how to create an electric field in real life I’d tell you that I have no idea. Theoretically you move the electrons but HOW and WHY. When would I ever be calculating an electrical field in my life? What possible job would make me pull out my calculator for this? I’m sure there is one, but no one has bothered to inform me of it in my class.

Everything just runs together in my head, and I feel like I haven’t learned anything because I can’t apply anything I’ve learned except to stupid word problems like “where is this particle in a infinjte well?” Yeah I could probably calculate it for you with the right equations but wtf is an infinite well in actual life? Everything just seems like a bunch of equations which popped out of thin air that I have to apply calculus to in order to solve, I have no context for anything that I’m doing. I literally need a class just to go over every single equation given to me in the past two years that would explain its derivation and what REAL LIFE context you would ever need to know this for. 

Okay my rant is over","[""*I feel like I haven’t learned anything because I can’t apply anything I’ve learned except to stupid word problems* \n\nYou've spent the last 4 years in academia.  You haven't even entered the job market or spent a single minute putting your skills to practical use, so how would you expect to know any of that?  \n\n\nI think a lot of students make the mistake in thinking that school is the be all to end all of knowledge. Chances are you will learn more in your first year at work then you will in all 4 years of college."", 'Seems like you are asking about electrical engineering which is where you would apply all of that.', 'I have a physics bachelor\'s and an astronomy PhD, and I think there are two possible ways I could interpret all the thoughts you\'re having now:\n\n1. Maybe what you really want is to be an engineer. That\'s where you take relatively simple ""intro"" ideas like Newtonian mechanics and thermodynamics and apply them to answer complex questions in real life. Not saying that engineering simple or easy, just that the underlying physics is not the upper level stuff like advanced E&M or quantum or whatever that is harder to touch with your own hands, and the interesting problems come from complex systems and the interactions within them rather than pure difficult concepts. If this applies to you, maybe consider an engineering masters. (side note: most research is similar to engineering in that you have a few basic concepts that you explore very deeply, so you only need a very focused area of expertise rather than a broad-based understanding. This is why grad students probably say that they don\'t use the material from whatever class you\'re talking about very often.)\n\n2. You may need to sit down and think about what motivated you to be a physicist in the first place. Generally, people don\'t make it through a whole physics degree unless they have an innate interest in understanding more about the universe and how it works through solving problems. For me, having a broad understanding of the way *things* function and the systems in the entire world is very satisfying, and that makes it worth it to do very abstract problems. Knowing how electric fields propagate through a dielectric material isn\'t usually applied, but if I think about why the sky looks less blue on a smoky day or why a piece of calcite exhibits birefringence, then I remember my undergrad E&M classes and have the physics framework to understand it. I may not ever calculate Lagrangians of double pendulums anymore, but having that background gives me the ability to intuit whether a system I see in daily life may be chaotic. The things you\'re learning as a physicist aren\'t necessarily the content of the classes, but the way of thinking, and I guarantee you that if you\'ve made it to the end, then you have a very good ability to see a system in the real world and simplify it into a model in your head so you can relate it to the things you already know. To me, that is the most satisfying and beautiful thing in physics.\n\nSo if what you want is applications, go engineering (or research or lab work or programming or whatever). But if you want simplicity and understanding, then I bet you\'ve learned more than you though you did.', 'If you have any electives left take one of the applied physics classes. And like someone said look into grad school 👍🏿', 'Such is the difference between theory and application! I felt similarly frustrated with my theoretical classes because we didn’t even delve into theory that was recent whereas my applied classes we were actually creating things and having conversations about how theory in practice impacts people & the things around us. Consider every theory class you’ve ever taken as the base knowledge you’ll need to be able to put into practice to problem solve at a job', ""Hey! First off, I feel you. It can be really hard to learn a bunch of theory without knowing why you're learning that stuff. A physics course has failed when it has only taught you the math and not the physical systems that it pertains to. The problem with a lot of E&M and Q. Mech is that real systems tend to be a lot more complex than most undergrad level theoretical models and so there are quite a few more advanced courses that you have to take before you get to explain some real physical systems. E.g. take atomic and molecular spectra that I deal with on a regular basis as an Astrophysics grad student. Although the time independent Schrodinger equation sets the foundation for atomic lines, there's a bunch more theory that deals with how light interacts with atoms before you start explaining the shape of atomic transitions and subsequently emission lines. Similarly in E&M, a lot of real life situations deal with collections of charges and thus their behavior is truly explained through a combination of statistical mechanics and electrodynamics. However, even the simple static, time-independent models are pretty close to the behavior of many many made systems, especially in electronics and electrical systems. Take for instance, QLED TVs. The Q part of the LED is basically a real life quantum particle in a box example. By changing the size of the box, you can tune the frequency if the light emission. Dielectrics are all around you. You have to worry about the material properties of air when designing electrical fuses. Coaxial cables have dielectrics in them. I can go on but hopefully you get the point. \n\nYou mentioned that your interactions with grad students gave you the impression that these equations are largely useless. A lot of grads feel that way because they tend to focus on a niche problem many a times brushes the fundamental physics under the rug. My own research for instance deals more with CCD data (basically photographs) processing but it is very important for me to not lose track of the underlying physics. That's what I have an advisor for. :) He reminds me constantly of why I'm doing what I'm doing and forces me to think first about the science, i.e. the physical system I'm trying to understand, than  the methodology, i.e. the theory and the implementation of it.\n\nIt sounds like there were not enough lab classes in your curriculum which had you model real physical systems, especially electrical circuits, with all the theory you've learnt.

There's also materials science if you found solid state coursework interesting. \n\nYou may also need to dig deeper into a niche of astrophysics (e.g. adaptive optics in astronomical telescopes) to find practical applications that interest you."", ""I agree with you 100%. The physics department is terrible when it comes to application and for students that don't plan on pursuing grad school. It's not very helpful to know theory without a use case, especially in interviews for internships/jobs.

You won't get much of the application side other than in your electives, and even then 10 weeks is much too quick to grasp the various topics.

You also have to break ties with any other place -- so if you own a car, it needs to be registered in CA.

First of all, the description on the UCSC website for STAT 80A is not accurate. ([https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/](https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/))

It does not highlight the **weekly labs** that you are going to be doing learning R (the coding language). Leading up to a final project that is a 4-5 page report using your newly acquired R prowess.

This leads up to my first gripe about the class. These lab sessions are an hour long each. We have maybe 9 lab sessions total. This class does not have any prerequisites. You can see how these things combined can make the class a bit of a struggle for students that take it without math or coding experience. **1 hour a week is not enough time to learn a language** you SHOULD assume is new to students! 

Leading to my second gripe: **an imbalance in group work**:

To counteract this lack of time, students are asked to put themselves into groups of 5 to work together on the projects, but when some students have coding experience and some do not, this creates a discrepancy where the students with experience have to choose between teaching their peers (which should not be their responsibility) and finishing the lab quickly.

What confuses me even more is that the TA that I was in contact with told me that having all the students learn R was not the goal, and that ""the more students with more coding experience were expected to carry their peers."" 

This goal makes even less sense as we begin to be asked to put the names of the people who worked on the project on the lab, and add percentages of group work distribution on our final project. These submissions aren't even anonymous. **Why breed unnecessary conflict??**

The goals that the TA and professor express aren't aligned with reasons to incorporate group work. If there were some prerequisites in math and coding added to the course, students would be able to know what they're getting themselves into.

However, this doesn't mean that I didn't have a poor learning experience. In fact, it was greatly education for me to complete **every** lab assignment, as I was able to practice my proficiency in the language and prepare myself for the final project. 

That is why I think that this class was a great learning experience for me. I hope this warning goes out to the students taking the class as though it is on an interesting topic, you have to be prepared for the workload (if you get unlucky, but what are the chances).","['Thank you for this post, I was thinking of doing Stats80A and this was a really helpful insight.\n\nEdit: grammar', 'Lol I wish more people made posts like these forming schedules would be a lot easier than navigating through a mix of 1&5 stars on almost every rate my professor.', ""This post kinda makes me glad they canceled it last Winter, I hate having to deal with student-lead group projects and I wouldn't have had a clue going into it.

Here's some more info (from the website): 

For every $1 raised, Second Harvest Food Bank provides 3 healthy meals. In Santa Cruz County, 1 in 3 people face hunger and Second Harvest is working hard to feed people who need food now and to advocate for policies that tackle the root causes of hunger. Every month, 65,000 local residents count on Second Harvest to avoid missing meals, empty stomachs, and impossible choices between food, housing, medicine, and other necessities. The organization sources over 8 million pounds of food each year and distributes it to 100 food pantries, schools (including UCSC Slug Support, SUA, and Family Student Housing for campus Basic Needs food pantries), soup kitchens, group homes, youth centers, and Second Harvest Program sites. 

100% of the proceeds from this campus-wide holiday donation drive benefit Second Harvest and Santa Cruz County residents. The work the food bank does is important to reduce food insecurity that many people in our community experience. You can learn more about Second Harvest at [thefoodbank.org](https://thefoodbank.org)

Ways to donate: Donate all types of Slug Points, Banana Bucks, and Flexi Dollars, including Points/Bucks and Flexis from Blue, Gold, or Banana Slug Points plans, and RA meal plans. You can donate from 5 to 50 Points/Bucks and Flexi Dollars (in increments of 5).

Takes 2 seconds, better to donate them than have them go to waste yk (Apologies in advance if this has already been posted before).

I will be attending UCSC in the Fall of 2024 and I have some concerns about the price of living or if its even worth living in Santa Cruz vs where I live now. Currently I live in San Jose, and it's about a 45-minute drive (with no traffic) to Santa Cruz. Since Im transferring I was planning on living on campus since It's the easiest thing to do and puts me closer to the school which helps since I will be doing research under professors along with normal upper div classes. But the money concerns came up, and I realized how much cheaper it would be to just live at home for a couple of quarters instead of living in santa cruz instead. Basically, what I'm trying to ask is: Is it worth living at home with my parents to save money for a couple of quarters and just commute to school every time I have class? I don't get the best mileage (about 25-26mpg) and it takes around 50ish dollars to fill up my tank each time. Im not sure how much it would cost to live in SC but the only thing I would really want if I lived there was my own room and a parking spot, I don't care how many roommates I would have as long as It's quiet. Would it be significantly cheaper to stay home and commute and save versus just living off-campus nearby?","['tbh u will be saving a lot in rent bc nothing here is cheaper than $1200 for your specifications. don’t forget to factor in wear and tear, plus slippery traffic conditions on the 17 in the winter', 'Commuting the 17 is a TOUGH drive back and forth, even just two days.

Really condensed, and I was remote for maybe... four or five months during long Covid.\n\nMy recommendations:\n- If you can put classes all on two days, do it. However, do not have it from 6am to 6pm for the love of god.\n- If your car has bad gas mileage, and you have the opportunity to do so, look into getting a more efficient vehicle. I downsized to a sedan from a compact gas SUV when I got into UCSC, and it helped offset costs from the commute.\n- Be extremely focused and plan out things in advance, course-wise. It sucks if you get bamboozled with a course that's only offered certain quarters and is at a stupid hour to drive to.\n- Little treats made the commute more bearable for me. I always got a croissant and matcha from Verve after my morning class and it was nice.\n- Pack lunch to save money, if you can, because it's a pain to get off campus and back if you have later classes.\n- Apply for the parking permit as soon as you possibly can. Get a remote parking pass, and you can take the bus (loop and metro). Loop will take you around campus, as the name implies. Metro is the regular bus which is free to students who provide current student ID. Don't take the metro if you can afford to wait for a loop bus.\n- I don't know how bad the bus is nowadays but I doubt it's improved much. Wear a good mask if you want to avoid getting sick, it's close quarters most of the time. The bus is usually late, so factor that into when you leave your house.\n\nFor me, it was a little harder because I can't climb uphill very easily due to my health, but if you're in better health than me, I think it'd make it a lot easier. If you are in similar health, uhhh... I sometimes had friends drive me up to social science hill and drive me back to my car. So that's an option!

Saving money is a big thing and understandable though.

Also, the 17 isn’t the safest during the winter months. This could also mean sacrificing time from studying so it’s important to weigh your options. A good middle ground would possibly be renting at a place like Watsonville where rent is cheaper and the commute is about 30 minutes give or take.

I'm not from around there and just would like to know your guys experiences with finding housing, and how much that is? Also if you did move to Santa Cruz to attend ucsc what did you do to find the money to attend.  Any information about finding the money to live and learn there would be amazing, thank you. (also as a side note what is it like just going there for school everyday? like what are your experiences?) :)","['Look at the housing prices of on campus housing to start with. I’ve paid 1400 and 1100 a month for single rooms, and both of those were living with more people than ideal. It’s also incredibly hard to find off campus housing, so many people end up settling for something outside of Santa Cruz or outside of their budget.', ' I became an RA to take care of my housing and food costs, it’s great. But you can’t do that your first year, you can apply for your second year. I believe freshmen also get priority housing so you should be set if you go that route — and actually get the RA job', ""Consider transferring after two years at a community college if you are concerned about cost and finding housing. Transfers also get priority for the first year and then you'll only have to find off-campus housing for your senior year."", ""To be honest, the cost of a room pretty much everywhere else in California is the same. Even if you rent a room from the Central Valley you're going to pay $1000 a month, so if Santa Cruz is $1500 a month, that's an extra $6000 a year, in the grand scheme of things it really aint that much more...  \n\n\nIf you are struggling and poor then I highly recommend to do community college first. Save up your money for 2 years, then come to Santa Cruz or another UC and use loans, savings, and jobs to get through it.  \n\n\nGetting pounded by 4 years of loan when you're already broke isn't really a good way to start off adulthood..."", 'I pay $1300 + utilities for a single in an apartment with one other person. I\'m in Santa Cruz proper but on the east side of the river which is a bit farther from UCSC and so a bit cheaper than housing on the west side. utilities and Internet come out to about $60-$100/month depending on how much we run the heater. Grocery bills have been going up, I used to pay about $50/week for food when I first moved year a year and a half ago, now it\'s like $75/week for food. I don\'t eat super cheap rice and beans type meals but I don\'t splurge on food either. I almost exclusively buy groceries and cook my own food, I very rarely eat out. \n\nI went to community college first, got a very specific degree that qualifies me for a job that pays $30+ an hour, and I work part time and go to school part time. But having that job also means I need to afford a car payment and gas to drive to San Jose and back 3x per week. I also picked up LSS tutoring this quarter to have some extra ""fun money"" because my other job and loan dispersements were really only covering my bills and essentials. I saved up a lot of money while in community college so I have a healthy savings account so I don\'t need to worry too hard about car repairs or vet bills for my cat, those I pay for with savings and then repay my savings account over time to get it back up to the amount I like to have. My mom is also available to help pay for things if I need it, she lets me use her Costco membership to get cheaper gas and pays for my cell phone and car insurance. She also co-signed my lease, so I didn\'t need to personally meet the income of 3x the rent requirement that most property management companies here have (but it also means she is on the hook for my rent if I ever don\'t pay it - which she would be willing to do anyway if something major came up and I needed to quit my job). \n\nIt is expensive here, and doing CC first so I don\'t need to work full time at a minimum wage job but can instead work part time at a much more rewarding job was definitely the best decision for me personally. I also never lived on campus because by the time I transferred I knew I wanted my own bedroom because sleep is a challenge for me and I didn\'t want to deal with other people in my bedroom disturbing me when I was trying to sleep. I also wanted control over who my housemate(s) were (I only have 1 but I was willing to have a few if necessary) to make sure they\'d be nice to my cat. Most people on campus are in triples, singles are apparently very limited. If you\'re willing to share a bedroom with 1-2 other people then housing can be much cheaper and living on campus can be a really convenient option.', 'The housing is the worst part. You only get 2 years of guaranteed on campus housing. As a Junior, if you’re lucky you’ll get housing and as a senior, it’s very very slim chance. Most people start looking for off campus housing a year in advance because all the good stuff will be taken. You likely won’t see anything for less than $1,000 per month. In addition, if you receive financial aid, the University will give you less money if you live off campus because it’s technically “cheaper” (meaning that on campus is only for 9 months while off campus usually requires you to sign a lease for a year)']"

Typically you take 10 units each quarter until you pass your qualifying exam to be considered full time.\n\nAfter the qualifying exam, you are considered advanced to candidacy. This means your focus is now on research and most phd students don't take classes anymore.

I need a lot of accomodations as well as will be taking an ESA with me to college so I wanted to know if anyone else who is disabled or just knows anything about it, if the university is good for disabled people? thanks!","['I’m not disabled, but have helped students navigate campus. For a physically disabled student, UCSC is the least friendly of the UCs, almost entirely because of the landscape. It’s in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. UCSC definitely tries but it’s hilly with tons of tree roots and levels. If you have a car with a placard, it’s significantly easier as most buildings have disabled parking close by. But otherwise it’s going to take a lot of time to go anywhere. Most students find it a challenge to get from class to class within the 15 minute break.', 'Im pretty sure TAPS can drive you to places on campus if ur disabled', ""Context: I'm a disabled student, who uses a cane to get around everywhere  \n\n\nUCSC is not disabled friendly. Our campus buses, housing, and classrooms are not accessible at all. When I came to UCSC I never imagined I would need an accessible space, but now that I do, I regret coming to UCSC. What UCSC does to for disabled people is the bare minimum, often only doing things so that they don't get sued.   \n\n\nYes we have a disability van service, but only because our campus buses are so old they're exempted from the ADA (buses maintained by the university so we don't have to comply with the ADA). Our campus environment routinely includes sharp hills, small pathways, and dirt walk ways. It is literally easier to walk on the roads in some places, then it is to take the paths since they make the roads flat but the paths not.   \n\n\nAs for accommodations, the DRC at our school is overwhelmed and unable to manage or help most disabled students. Students have had to form a DSU (Disability Student Union) in order to get the DRC to fix or even address some of the basic problems on campus. I have routinely had professors deny accommodations or provide lack luster attempts to meet them.   \n\n\nIf accessibility is your main concern when choosing a school, don't come to UCSC"", 'absolutely not lol not disabled friendly', ""I have heard of people who get a DRC accomodation letter for a single and still get placed in a double/triple/quad because there's no available singles. If that's something that would be a need of yours then I would reconsider. If your only housing accomodation you would need is an ESA, then I have not heard of people having any problems with those, as long as your ESA will get along well with roommates and you clean up after your ESA appropriately.\n\nThe DRC has no way to actually force professors to give you academic accomodations that you request, and I have heard of people having problems with this. If the academic accommodations you need are extensive, I'd call or email the DRC at UCSC and explain what you explained above, let them know what accomodations you would need/expect, and ask if students ever have problems getting those accomodations. I don't know which accomodations tend to cause problems.\n\nAs the other commenter said, the campus is physically very inaccessible. There is an e-bike share company that came in this year that seems to be pretty popular that you might have luck with, and there is also a disability van service, but I've heard mixed reviews on the van service's reliability. If you can get in and out of a bus (with stairs, no ramps) then loop busses should help a lot with your getting around campus as long and you don't schedule back-to-back classes, but there are some parts of campus that the loop busses don't get very close to and you may still have to walk around half a mile (with hills and stairs) from the closest bus stop to wherever you're going. I love taking my e-bike to campus as it helps me get around a lot faster, but I live off campus and can store my ebike on my 2nd-storey balcony where theft would be rather difficult. I don't know if the bike storage for people who live on campus would be adequate for you to not have an e-bike stolen if you were living on campus and wanted your own e-bike instead of using the e-bike share. \n\nFrom my experience at both community college and UCSC, community colleges tend to be much more disability friendly than UCSC is in basically all regards. I would look into community college and transferring as an option to save money and to also get used to college coursework somewhere where accomodations are more normalized and honestly where the professors actually give a shit about their students. Many lower division classes are so large at UCSC that the professors literally don't have time to care about any of their students, and the quality of teaching you'll get from TAs varies dramatically. At community college I found all of my professors very willing to make time to help students who needed it, and that's just not the vibe from professors here. Obviously your mileage may vary at a different community college than the one I went to, but I would check out your local community college options (or even cabrillo and de anza, which are the CC's closest to UCSC) and see if they look like a good fit for you, too, and then you can transfer to UCSC with a trabsfer agreement guarantee (for most majors), too."", 'Do not choose this place. I’ve heard so many disabled persons complain and I do sympathize with them, but UCSC is the LEAST accessible campus for people w disabilities. Most athletic people here find themselves winded walking across campus, that says a lot.', 'DRC is great and can help a lot, but traversing this campus as a disabled person is a nightmare.', ""I agree with some other people on the general inaccessibility for the physical disabilities. I have totally seen people do it who are wheel chair users though. They will let you allow your ESA if you live on campus. The DRC kicks absolute ass. I can now say this firmly comparing it to the grad school that I'm at now where the disability offices sucks hard core. Furthermore, UCSC is the school that introduced me to disability studies! There is a better culture there than I've personally experienced otherwise. I hated to leave it."", 'As far as academic accommodations go, it is not difficult to get them from the DRC. But the way that accommodations are done at ucsc require you to at hand in your accommodations without anonymity. And it’s not uncommon for professors to either reject some or all accommodations. Other schools do anonymous grading or at least anonymous accommodations so you do not have that power dynamic.', 'Personally I’ve heard negative things including someone who had to call the ambulance on themselves or having to treat their hidden disability themselves because the health service wouldn’t listen to them.

I live on campus and UCSC\'s TAPS has a van called ""Disability Van Service"" and they would pick you up at a specific area and drop you off wherever you need to get to. It was very nice but DVS only goes to specific areas and sometimes you\'d need to walk for a pretty long to get anywhere regardless. I ended up going home because UCSC was not very disabled accommodating (uneven paths, unwalkable areas). I can’t speak much for mental disabilities. They do have the DRC (disability resource centers) which they\'re are able to assist in requesting accommodation for classes and such. Hope this helps :)', 'I recommend calling and connecting with the DRC apartment ahead of time and asking them questions !!', ""Believe it or not, I had a friend in a wheelchair that got around pretty well on campus. It's a large hilly campus but you'll meet so many great friends that will help you out and disability services will be on top of your needs but it's a great question to bring up just because it is such a beautiful scenic area. You probably already do this but you must allow yourself plenty of time to get to your class because even with students with a good walking stride, it takes time to get around.

I'm currently enrolled in CSE102 (Chatzafraitis), CSE103 (Bailey), and CSE115A (Jullig) for the next quarter. I'm currently a Junior.

I was wondering how doable these 3 classes together would be? I don't have any GEs left so I'm down to just enrolling in 3 CS classes til I graduate.

Thanks.

I tagged UCSC and I am probably going to end up going here. I am from Orange County California. Plz give me an honest review of what life is like at UCSC in regards to housing, party culture, things to do outside of campus, what people are like,  what’s with the stoner and drug stereotype? Etc. Thanks again.","[""It's going to be the opposite of Orange County. UCSC is a good school, but it can have a niche culture, and it does have its issues like housing. You'll be able to fit in, but I wouldn't expect something like a USC or UCSB environment and something closer to Cal, except maybe more counterculture vibes and perhaps a worse housing situation depending on how you evaluate it."", 'To start, the area is incredibly beautiful. By far my favorite part of living here. The social clicks are kinda tricky if you dont make a friend group early on, but if youre pretty extroverted you should be fine. You should research the different residential colleges though to make sure you end up in the right social environment. Its a little tricky to get around if you wanna explore outside of the immediate area, but the bus system will connect you around town and theres plenty of things to do. The academic experience is different for every major but for impacted majors classes usually fill up super fast. I recommend walking to your classes instead of using the busses but its a big campus so walks can take up to 25 minutes. Dining hall food is alright, nothing special but not terrible. There are a few alternates in terms of food that you can use your meal points on too. Im not a huge partier but ive been to a few of the forest parties and ive had an amazing time at all of them. The nightclub in downtown also hosts events that lots of people say rlly good things about. Either way, i think its a super cool school and i would say you should definitely keep looking into it! if you have any questions feel free to ask', 'A lot of clubs for a lot of stuff. Very weed heavy culture so most parties are naturally kick backs with a lot of smoking unless it’s a house party off campus. Mostly chill vibes. In terms of education if you put in the effort and use the resources you’ll get a whole lot of it. Staying fit mostly consists of doing sports and other activities in clubs since the gym is so small. Food is decent, nothing terrible but not great either. The campus itself is beautiful and I would recommend if you can to never take the bus and walk everywhere. Nothing is more than a 20-30 min walk away. So if you have time to do so I’d strongly recommend it. Again strong emphasis on clubs, there will 100% be something you’ll enjoy and find interesting. The people in my 4 years there were always accommodating, nice, non combative and chill. Honestly a good school if you don’t fall into the “stats and rankings” pit. That negativity is the only thing that will ruin your experience.', 'I feel like it’s polar like it’s either the perfect school for you and you’ll love it or you won’t. If you haven’t already you should definitely visit before making a decision. Touring and talking to students really helped me solidify my decision to come here and I have no regrets!', 'Housing is difficult to get and expensive. There’s no sugar coating it, it’s one of the craziest housing markets in CA.\n\nThere isn’t really a party culture here. People hang out with friends at kickbacks mostly. You gotta go to at least one forest party just to experience it imo, but they get old quick. There’s a couple campus clubs and frats that host parties but it’s mostly freshmen who go to those. The dive bars downtown and elsewhere in SC are fun for 21+. There’s not much nightlife for the clubbing type of people, but I personally love the “grungier” side of SC’s bars. Some students in bands put on garage shows, which are fun. A lot of people smoke weed, and those who don’t are not bothered by it. If you’re bothered by weed, don’t come here. 4/20 is basically an unofficial holiday here.\n\nPeople here are generally really easy going and friendly. The school is very left leaning, no surprise there. The academic culture is not at all competitive. Sometimes the activism culture can feel performative, and on the other hand there’s a lot of people who get pissy and grumble about any sort of protest even though they chose to go to a school that’s known for counterculture and activism. Both are annoying.\n\nStudents aren’t really involved in the town community, which is a shame. Campus is kind of its own entity. The community is pretty skeptical of students because of that. It’s a shame bc the locals here are friendly and there’s so much rich culture (surfing, remnants of anti-Vietnam), but very few people at UCSC seem to want to interact with them much.', 'as someone who spent a few years already here at ucsc and has visited ucb, LA, and orange county i’d say they are quite different. to my knowledge of the few places i’ve been, la feels like a more sketchy berkeley while orange county would be like the rural outskirts but i do love the outlet there. ucsc is more like small city with beautiful campus and beach but lacks a ton of big brands. if you want some big brand products you’d have to try online to closest would be San Jose. Here downtown i’ve only seen a few clothing stores, jewelry, crafts store, food, food, and oh did i mention food? haha\n\nit’s definitely nicer than orange county id say but has less and is just a smaller city', ""It's a very small town with very little to do, so if you don't figure out a way to have fun on your own accord you'll be extremely bored. Seeing that you're from OC, I would definitely visit first and just ask random students any questions you have. Most ppl here are very nice compared to other schools they won't mind answering your questions. \n\nComing here will be the absolute opposite of the OC/LA experience. There is no city life unless you want to drive up to the Bay all the time, but it's a lengthy drive and it's not really worth it unless you're doing it with other people. If a big city-esque nightlife/social scene is really important to you, I would definitely think twice before coming here. \n\nI won't get too much into the educational side as it's major dependent, but I'd say the professors are pretty good (lots of good ones, some bad ones) and you'll learn a lot from every course if you really put the effort in. I'm a CS major for clarification. The GE's here are definitely lacking compared to other schools (just not as many interesting offerings); I'd honestly say that most GE's I took felt like a waste of time so do with that what you will.\n\nI think the worst part of this school is the lack of facilities/amenities. We just simply have nonexistent/lacking facilities here. We have one, tiny gym in a pretty inconvenient location and it is extremely crowded 80% of the time it's open (Expect a 1 hour workout at your commercial gym to take 2 hours here). We have one, small basketball court which is also used for badminton, volleyball, and other sports so you'll basically never have an opportunity to use it. There are also no real community centers that make it easy to meet people (for reference UCSD has sky lounges, cafes, restaurants on campus, computer labs, and they just built a brand new esports center just for students). Our dorms don't have communal kitchens, we don't really have central quad areas, central marketplaces, or anything like that. \n\nTL;DR: Good people, nice-looking campus, generally good professors/classes, small boring city, terrible/nonexistent amenities at the school"", 'What we’re seeing in this thread is this: \n\nPeople who like UCSC are telling you good things about this university.

Equally, people who don’t like UCSC are presenting a very particular set of facts.\n\nYet, for whatever reason, people think their opinion is the objectively correct one.\n\nThe only way to get a truly accurate assessment of this university is to believe everything you’ve read about it in this thread and then experience it yourself.', 'Chillaf but serious', ""It's chill, but to get good food, hope you like risking your life driving up to San Jose on the 17."", ""You gotta visit to see if you like it.

You can get something much nicer for the same price per month down in Irvine.

He ended up on a floor in Cowell with super cool kids and they instantly all became best friends. They take the bus downtown, some raves, and a few parties, but love Bonfires on the beach, game nights, and hanging out in the trees. You find things to do that you are interested in like one boy surfs and a girl scuba dives, another in the orchestra or there are a lot of academic clubs. My son lifeguards and plays club water polo. He says it's true that almost everyone there smokes pot. Some moms complain their freshmen have a hard time making friends but honestly, there are tons of things to do. Each college hosts events and if you put yourself out there you will find your tribe. It's nothing like UCLA. My son's girlfriend goes there and says UCSC is much more chill.

It's rated as one of the most beautiful campus in the US and it makes sense. Only bummer is sometimes u gotta break a good sweat getting to class. As for things to do off campus there is a good amount to keep u busy. Going to different beaches, going downtown, boardwalk, hiking, beach volleyball, etc. also lots of cool shops. Party culture is definitely large but not as big as other schools like UCSB. Most parties are on campus in the forest and you can find a few off campus house parties as well. Unless ur in a frat which is also not as big as other schools there aren't a ton of parties happening. Stoner culture is definitely very real here 90% of the people I know smoke at least socially. But there are also lots of people who don't as well it's all who you hang with but for the most part majority do in my experience."", 'Bring a heavy jacket and buy an umbrella. It’s colder.']"

One of my professors has been holding my accommodations over my head all year and not allowing them unless I provide additional medical records for him. Around mid-quarter my grade was failing due to my accommodations being denied. Professor kept telling me he needed more information about my medical records. I finally caved in last week and signed an ROI so he would finally give me accommodations. He looked through my files and still said no. I feel like I just got played. I was so nervous about the ROI, but did it anyway so I could finally get my accommodations. I’m pretty ashamed of my disability so allowing him to see that and for him to not take it seriously just reinforced my shame.

I go to a college preparatory school so around now is the time where we all start kinda focusing on what colleges we want to get into. I’m really into UCSC not only because the environment is literally beautiful but they also offer majors that I’m into. I just wanted to ask a few questions because most people in this group actually go. 

1. How are the people/professors? Would you say it’s very cliche to the movies or a calming environment? 

2. Is the workload terrible or over stressing? Are classes very interactive or typically lecture style?

3. What’s the housing and food situations like? Are dorms good? Is the food bad?

4. How is the diversity? Would you say racism is common?

5. How much do you pay per year for housing, exams, supplies, etc? (If answering in a range or approximation is possible, please do that!)

Those are currently my main concerns so if anyone would take the time to answer, that would be great!

Have a good day!","[""1. Professors are generally nice, though youll have the occasional difficult one like at any university\n2. depends on your major completely. Some majors will have high workload (particularily STEM), some will not. Most lectures are not really interactive, since they are a means for the professor to convey information to you, however if your major requires supplemental labs then those are more interactive.\n3. Food is ok, its sometimes hit or miss. Its meant to appeal to everyones palette. Havent personally lived in the dorms myself but I know people who have. It completely depends on the college you get in. Kresge will have super modern dorms, while Crown's dorms are outdated and really packed. On campus apartments are way better.\n4. This is probably one of the most liberal colleges in america. Actually I think it is ranked as the most liberal college in america. Racism is not at worry here. Diversity completely depends on what major you are, what college your at, etc. In general its a pretty diverse school, you can find the statistics online somewhere.\n5. Housing is expensive. When I was living in a triple in an on campus apartment I was paying around 1300 per month. Now I live off campus and was lucky to score a single for around 700 a month, but thats not the rule and more of the exception. On average, singles off campus are about 1300-1500 a month. Im a Computer Engineering Major, so I dont spend much on supplies, if at all. I do must of my work on my laptop or on my computer, and any material needed for my lab classes are provided by the university for me. Cant say anything about other majors though. Off campus, I spent around 200-300 a month on food, 100 on utilities. On campus, if you live in the dorms you are required to get a meal plan, which is a couple thousand per quarter? Check the dining website for meal plan prices. If you live in the on campus apartments it isnt required to get a meal plan. Apartments are only available to 2nd years and above. \n\nIn the end, its a really nice university, but you have to realize that since you live in a different state, it will be more expensive in terms of tuition. If you have the means to pay for it and are willing to shell out 50k+ per year for a mid-low tier UC, then go ahead. If not, maybe consider other schools, even ones in your own state which can provide cheaper tuition to NY state residents."", 'Staying instate is a good option.']"

Which to me is already a red flag to be a republican in 2023. My first conversations with him were about who he supported, he used to support trump and used to support DeSantis. His reasoning for not supporting them are very telling to me. He said that he doesn't support Trump cause he's an idiot(more respectable of him to admit it) which i interjected about how he also violated the constitution and he pretended as if that was a debatable topic cause its just a fact lile gravity. 
Then he said that he doesn't support DeSantis because he's weak, not cause of DeSantis book banning or his handling of covid, etc etc and said that we need a strong leader. 

Then we talked about Israel and how it's a war crime for them to block all access to water and food and electricity when the genocide started. He said they had to it because hamas would steal it from the people which was stupid and basically justifying starving people to death which already irk me and made me not like him.

Then my most recent conversation with him was about how Israel knew about the October 7th attack and he at first dismissed it. Then u told him it was not that reported and he said, ""I have to look into that more but I doubt their reporting"" and I said, ""well I do to because they tend to be very bias in favor of Israel not the other way around"" then he said that biden is putting restrictions on Israel and I interjected saying that no he just gave them full access to our military stockpile and he said they just stopped it. Then I said we'll that's a good thing cause they're committing war crimes, and the motherfucker said, ""well Israel has to commit war crimes"" I can't make this shit up!!!!! And I just walked out and he wanted to get into it as if it was a debating topic to say a country of any kind has to commit war crimes!!!

Thanks!","['im trans and graduating this quarter. ive never had a problem. tbh I dont think the vast majority of people have noticed or cared. like other people have said, UCSC is mad liberal so ur pretty safe here. abundance of gender neutral bathrooms on campus if ur not comfortable using ur gendered bathroom for any reason yet.\n\ntrans housing is pretty fire too. dorms for first years but apartments for transfers and continuing students, and decent apartments at that. I actually think I met more enby trans people than binary, too, so being trans is super accepted. plenty of trans faculty too (also enby as far as I know, based on pronouns alone. dont know of any out binary trans profs but that doesnt mean they dont exist).\n\nlots of UCSC policies to help protect LGBT+ people in general. worst case scenario, u reach out to faculty for an intervention (never heard of this needing to happen based on LGBT discrimination). most commonly, might need to let ur profs/peers know ur pronouns if ur misgendered. smaller classes usually have u introduce urself with pronouns tho so its a pretty uncommon occurrence. only time it happened to me, my professor apologized profusely before I even had the chance to talk to him about it lol.', 'I’ve never seen anybody get harassed for being lgbt here, from my experience it’s very accepting.

The TAs are usually pretty active there.', ""Here's a great Coursera course for learning C and whatnot\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/coding-for-everyone"", 'Make sure you take the assignment report stage seriously. It helps you understand how your code will work before you actually write any code, and visualize the algorithms or control flow of the program. This honestly applies for any CS class – I think a lot of the time there’s an instinct to jump straight into writing code but it becomes so much easier if you draw everything out on paper beforehand so that when you write the code there’s focus put on the programming language instead of program design.', 'Go to section.

If you have a background in C you'll probably do well but if not, all I can really say is start extremely early and hopefully you can slack off a little bit on your other classes as this is really a class that needs all your attention. Many of the assignments are time consuming and the assignment descriptions are pretty abstract sometimes so you need to be prepared to ask questions and work on it right when it comes out. I didn't go to sections as I fell behind but I've heard some others who got some good help on their assignments there. So make sure your schedule can accommodate the TA sections and office hours and you should be fine. That and you are taking other classes that aren't stressful."", 'start ASAP and go to office hours, this is a habit that’s important to build up because you will need it for all future CS classes. i recommend teaching yourself some C and at least having an idea of what a Makefile is and how to write it — this is a kinda random thing to mention but when I took 13 it was the first quarter he taught it and he didn’t give you makefiles nor teach us what a makefile was til week 7 even though we used it in assignments all quarter. anyway, make sure you’re comfortable with that Lol', '13s is all C programming so i would recommend  brushing up on your C programming and having a good foundation. Also use your TAs', ""I would say that the biggest down fall students have in these classes is time management.   \n\n\nEvaluating a problem and coming up with a workable solution takes time.  \n\n\nPutting that solution into workable code takes time.  \n\n\nTesting that solution and resolving bugs takes time.  \n\n\nThere is always some student who wants to do short cuts. They want to start coding at the last minute but they never took time to evaluate the problem so they get stuck. Or they took time to evaluate the problem and code it out, but no time to test it or look for bugs, so they turn in something that fails half the tests.  \n\n\nThe way you resolve this is by showing up to every class and every section. This will ensure you're picking up all the tips and tricks and hints that you can, it will also allow you to talk with TAs and professor during Office Hours which is a huge resource.  \n\n\nMake sure that you're reading your C book BEFORE class. You should know how the code works before you get to class. That way you can focus your thinking on algorithms rather than syntax.  \n\n\nStart on assignments early. You get 2 weeks to do assignments, nearly all of them take about a week or more to complete for a new programmer. So if you're starting on day 6 or 7 then you're shooting yourself in the foot, especially if you're new."", ""My two cents as someone who did it very chaotically:\n- As much as I am a hypocrite for saying this, start early. If you don't have the incentive to, just try to write for two minutes at the start of the week. If you figure out what to do, great! If not, go to the professor's office hours or a tutor's. \n- Consider reading the book. It's good practice to, at the very least, skin through the harder concepts like pointers.\n- Just talk to people who've gotten through the class. You might find some sage advice that I can't think of."", ""Get started on your assignments as soon as possible, that way you know what questions to ask your TA in sections.   \nYou can go to sections you are not enrolled in, very useful if you run into questions on the assignment after your section for the week.   \nUse the Slack for the class if you have questions, even if it seems like a minor thing, you'd be surprised how many people might be running into the same problem as you.   \nBe prepared to do extra work when your program fails to pass the autograder; pay very close attention to the error messages it gives, sometimes it might be as minor as forgetting to put an extra space in your printf statement. This is also why getting started early is important."", 'Start stuff early and if you have a question ask a tutor/TA. If you do that you will be fine.', ""You'll be fine I promise"", 'lots of good tips already mentioned. section and OH usually serve different purposes, so ideally you go to section every week and OH for more direct help. \n\nIf you do go to professor/TA OH and it’s not too busy, you should ask if they’re willing to look at your reports and tell you how you can improve. dont underestimate how important doing those right is. \n\nalways read the fine print!!!', ""Taking it this quarter. You should try understanding the programming assignment immediately after it's released and start thinking about the different components you will need to implement your solution effectively. \n\nHowever, I would actually give different advice from other people here and say that I wouldn't actually start coding until at least two days after the PDF is released because it's always riddled with mistakes and random little errors that will cause you immense frustration and waste your time for no reason; these always get fixed after a few days when the people who worked on it first realize all the mistakes that are present and the design document consequently gets updated.\n\nThe one other important thing is to heavily read/utilize the Discord/slack that is used for the class. People will ask and answer questions there, and the TAs are very active on it as well. This is probably the single most important feature that you should utilize in the class. I can honestly say that I would spend at least 3-4x longer on this class every week if I did not read our Slack chats thoroughly. \n\nLastly, I'm going to have one more contrarian point here and say that I never went to a single lecture or section and I'm doing fine. I can't really speak for sections as they're all unique and whether or not they're helpful is kind of random and a matter of luck. However, I don't think the lectures really help at all with the assignments bc everybody seems to be starting from square one on any given PA just from reading the slack chats. You're definitely going to be learning all of the necessary info by yourself just from your own research, so you might find it helpful to just skip lectures altogether and instead utilize that time to learn on your own.""]"

You’re right about Porter having a large transfer community, but it’s also the “art” college. I think you’d be a good fit for Porter if you went there. However, Merrill (my affiliation) is often concerned with humanities and global consciousness and I’ve never had an issue making friends also in the arts despite it. The only thing affiliation matters for is choosing roommates for on-campus housing (you and your prospective roommates have to share an affiliation in order for you to request them) and the Core classes. However, transfers don’t have to take Core.\n\nThe other comment mentions CSGD, but that program has fallen off recently from what I’ve heard from those in the department. UCSC is also a wonderful school with the only major issue being the housing crisis. Please don’t let that discourage you, though. This school is amazing at giving students benefits and resources, and you’re also guaranteed housing as a first-year transfer. It is ranked low on most college-ranking websites, but that’s often because UCSC doesn’t have many celebrity alumni nor one big major everyone’s gunning for. \n\nI’d say you’re making the right choice in terms of AGPM/game design if you choose to come to UCSC for it. Hope this helps!']"

>**METRO Serves Rising Transit Demand at UCSC with Additional Extra Long Buses**  
>  
>METRO has secured a fleet of 12 extra-long, articulated buses to meet surging transit demand at the UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus. There are currently four, 60-foot articulated buses serving the campus with six more expected to be put into service by the end of 2023 and two in reserve.   
>  
>UCSC riders constitute almost 70% of METRO’s total ridership systemwide. At the start of the 2023 fall term, METRO carried an average of 13,409 UCSC riders per day. This compares to 10,349 average daily UCSC riders in September 2022, a leap of almost 30%.   
>  
>To address the rising demand on campus, METRO struck an agreement with the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) to purchase ten 60-foot articulated buses to augment the two METRO-owned articulated buses already serving the campus. Two of the ten MTS buses were put into service during the second week of the school year with another three more expected to arrive and begin serving the campus within the next two weeks. METRO expects to receive a total of ten articulated buses from MTS by the end of 2023.   
>  
>“UCSC students, faculty, and staff are our largest population of riders and we appreciate their commitment to environmentally friendly transportation,” said METRO Board Chair, Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson “That’s why it was so important for METRO to act quickly to secure more fleet capacity and ensure everyone who wants to ride the bus has a chance to do so.”   
>  
>An articulated bus can accommodate 60-65 seated passengers with room for an additional 15-25 standing passengers while a traditional 40-foot bus can carry 36 seated passengers with an additional 10-15 standees, depending on the make and model of the bus.   
>  
>METRO’s articulated buses will be wrapped with iconic images of Monterey Bay wildlife, such as sea lions, kelp forests, and sea jellies, as part of METRO’s One Ride at a Time campaign (ORAT). ORAT is a key element of METRO’s efforts to be an environmentally focused community partner in Santa Cruz County. ORAT gives riders the opportunity to protect the Monterey Bay’s extraordinary natural resources just by simply riding the bus. Thanks to ORAT, every ride on a METRO bus contributes to our partners in protecting the environment, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Foundation and the Bay of Life Fund.

Right now I'm trying to sort out my grades and figure out what's salvageable and I am considering taking a break in the winter quarter to be with family. I have strong grades in three out of four classes, but my grade in chem lab is a bit shaky. I missed a lab day a few weeks ago, when thought I had the flu.

Walking home with no inhaler with asthma and post covid symptoms is basically a death sentence for my respiratory system.

If I submit my work and at worst get a 65% on them, I'd end the class with around a 72% in the class. Is that considered failing by ucsc standards? Will I still get credit for the class?

Despite this, I decided to go easy on the courseload this semester in anticipation of the class being hard. I decided to take CSE 130 and two easy GEs.  


People were lying. CSE 130 is easily the hardest class I've ever taken. The first PA took me forty hours of actively working - I use Pomodoro to keep myself focused. I go to every single tutor and ta office hour I can. I work to the point where I'm sleeping less than three hours a night and I still manage to finish late. I don't understand how this class is supposed to be humanly possible.  


If you think the PAs are hard, don't even get me started on the midterms. The first midterm, I studied for a least a week before and I show up day of and understand none of the questions. The test might as well have been written in German. I show up to every single lecture and sit in the front row - and yet I recognized none of the terms EVEN AFTER STUDYING FOR A WEEK. I literally left after thirty minutes after I submitted a blank sheet.  


For the second midterm, I studied for two weeks coming up to it. I talked to the professor after class to try and get clarification on the material and in general put a lot more effort than I normally do. My social life suffered immensely from my struggle to succeed in this class. Despite this, we had the midterm today and it went awful. I knew two of the multiple choice questions and the rest were ancient egyptian to me. Don't even get me started on the FRQ section. I used to be a TS fan but now I despise her.   


At this point, I don't have a lot of options. I'm planning dropping out of UCSC as soon as I can. Thanks to all the friends that tried to help me with understanding CS. Maybe in another life I'd have a better shot.","['Yeah Upper Div CS classes are weird sometimes they click and you can just naturally grasp and comprehend material better and other times they are just unbearably difficult to comprehend. Talk to your professor about your position in the class and see if it’s possible for you to pass. Careers aren’t based on you being able to understand every concept of every class you took. Most of the classes you take you will never need. Don’t get discouraged. Your feelings are valid, but sometimes in the heat of the moment emotions can cloud rational thought. I would recommend getting a good night of rest and trying to rationalize the choices you want to make regarding your future.', 'Drop out for just one class??  You survived all the lower-division, with 16, 13S, 12, 101, 30 (in random order), and now you want to drop because ONE upper div you find it hard? \n\nHang on best you can.  Then take other upper divs to build stronger background, and try again.  You can also study the subject on books on your own in preparation for taking it again. Not everything works on the first try.', 'don’t drop out! Switch to a BA if you don’t wanna do 130', 'Im a computer engineering major here in my 5th year. If I had a dollar every time I convinced myself that I wasn’t cut out for this major, or that I should drop out or change majors, I definitely wouldn’t need this degree in the slightest. This curriculum is designed to push you to your limits and yes, weed some people out in the process, but I promise you with enough sheer persistence even the spaciest people can make it through, myself being my primary example! I would stick with it and see how the class ends up before making any crazy decisions. If others are struggling in the class as well the professor is likely to offer extra credit or a curve towards the end of the quarter. One nice thing about UCSC is that if you do happen to fail, you can retake the class and overwrite the grade. This pushes you back slightly, but is really not as bad as people think. This has happened to me and the 2nd time I took the course, material I once thought to be so far out of my understanding was much easier to grasp. Eat, sleep, and stay positive!', 'I’m sorry you had to deal with this this quarter… don’t give up though even if you don’t pass this quarter you can try again, and if it’s not for you that’s ok.

Like someone said, you can always switch to BA to avoid 130 and other cs classes all together if you are having a hard time with the upper divs. I personally wouldn’t recommend switching to cs minor because the market is already bad enough that a CS degree is the bare minimum for entry to the field.', 'Graduated with a BS in CS back in 2021, failed CSE 130 the first time I took it. I will say though, that it was the hardest class I took at UCSC (except maybe CSE 138). Things clicked and I got past it the second time I took it. You will not struggle nearly as much with other upper divs. I would not recommend giving up on CS yet.', 'Is everyone talking about Quinn’s offering of the class or veenstra or both? Is one more difficult than the other?', 'Have you ever heard of the strategy where you add an item to your Amazon cart but wait 2-3 weeks until you buy it to see if you really need it or if its just a impromtu buy?\n\nIn the same way maybe you can take a step back, finish the course best you can, and then think about your choice to drop out, change majors, or whatever then? Maybe you decide NO! I don\'t want to do this!. So be it, but perhaps its better to spend such energy deciding that when you are out of your ""impromptu buy"" zone?\n\nSome other points to consider:\n\n1. Perhaps there is a disconnect from what you are studying/taught at lectures and what is on the test? Perhaps if you took a different approach in trying to first ask yourself a) what will be on the test, then working backwards from there you would do better? For example I took multivariable calc, and in the lectures there was some not-so-clear to me math logic stuff,..... **but** if I rmb correctly the test had mostly, if not all, algebra number type problems, not theory problems,.... so the smart thing to do for my grade would be to forget about the lecture theory stuff and focus on the algebra....It seems like you mentioned a similar thing ""I recognized none of the terms"". Maybe what is taught in lecture is different from what is on the test?\n2. Can you find some people in your class who are doing well? Can you ask them what they do and try to copy their formula/approach? Or a TA who has taken the class before? Perhaps they would study something different than you are?\n3. There might be a  disconnect between what you learn at school and what you will use on the job (depending on what you do). For exmaple, you might learn assembly language,..... but do you think most companies hire engineers to code in assembly? So rather than thinking ""i\'m not cut out for cs"" on the basis of one class, perhaps take a bigger picture look regarding the relationship between your classes, your degree, and potential jobs for you post grad, and how they might not be as closely related as you might think.\n4. How is your mental well-being? What kind of image do you hold in your head about yourself?Are you getting enough sleep? Good food, water, salt, etc? Is lack of sleep or stress affecting your logical/cognitive mind capabilities making this class harder than it needs to be?', 'I remember I took this class with a horrible professor and it was just an awful experience except the TA was amazing and basically taught the class.

I have a 3.7 (maybe 3.6) weighted gpa, will get 3 associates (engineering, math, and Physics), no clubs or sport (due to work). I have a good comeback story that colleges seem to like.

1. Lower Div classes are considerably easier than Upper Divs. (Not Including weeder classes)
2. Upper Div classes are more interesting than the Lower Divs
3. Interesting upper div classes with good professors can be hard to get into because:
   1. Everybody wants them so they get filled up quickly
   2. They may be offered infrequently depending on the department for the class, especially if you want to take it with a specific professor

Thus:

* Pros:

1. If there was a best time to take 4 classes at once it would be in your under-divs where all the classes are easier.
2. Taking more classes in your freshmen year gets you ahead on the curriculum, this means that you get to the more interesting classes quicker than if you didn't.
3. Getting ahead in your classes opens up your opportunities:
   1. Graduate early
   2. Double &/or Minor
   3. Don't have to worry about not getting all your classes done in time to graduate in 4 yrs
   4. Take more upper divs & electives that you are interested in taking
4. Getting ahead of your peers in the same school year gives you better priority than them. Usually, students in the same year go for the same classes, this will give you a better pick than them and a higher likely hood getting into these interesting classes with good professors.
5. If you are able to obtain senior standing ahead of being senior not only do you have the priority of a senior when picking classes (which is the highest without doing a special program like sports or an honors group), but you also can choose 3 classes in your first pass instead of 2!

* Cons:

1. Taking four classes takes up more of your weekly time to join clubs, hang out with and make new friends, go to parties, do other extracurriculars, have personal time, etc.
2. Taking four classes might be too hard for you if you are already finding it hard to do three. Everyone learns at their own pace, and it's possible that three classes are already hitting that sweet spot for you where if you take any more it'll be too much.

Caveat: Of course, this depends on your classes. Some are harder/easier than others, and I would suggest strategizing by looking at your department's tentative class schedule for the school year to plan ahead and your courses.

Conclusion:

Taking 4 classes in your Freshman and Sophomore year doing your Under-Divs can have very significant benefits. However, you still may find it unfavorable depending on how much you value its Pros vs. its Cons. It's definitely totally valid to not take 4 classes per quarter for your under-divs, but it can be an enticing option if you feel like your current course load of 3 a quarter is an easy-moderate difficulty that I would suggest you consider.

Also I'm taking 4 classes right now and 3 of them are upper divs, it's totally doable depending on the upper div class you're taking.

Edit: Update for everyone. I visited Bcycles Santa Cruz hq and spoke to the manager. Three weeks ago one of my bcycles wouldn’t dock properly, the bike locked into the dock without beeping or sending me a notification that my trip had ended. I proceeded to contact support and virtually verified the drop off with a picture. Turns out somebody jacked the bike right after and stripped it for parts. They found the frame yesterday, (some of you probably saw another redditor post about it) and charged me once they made the connection.

Upon speaking to the manager, he was adamant that I am liable considering I was the last person to unlock the bike.

I understand the consensus here is that Kevin Jones is not exactly a great professor, however, most of the ratemyprofessor reviews and comments on this sub are about his online class, because he gives a lot of homework and people are creeped out by proctoru. Next quarter he is offering an in person 10B class, and I am wondering if anyone has taken it and can tell me if it is any similar to his online offerings.","['I had Kevin Jones as both online and later in person classes. I personally borderline hated his online class as I felt he never gave enough information (as in how the hw would work, how quizzes/tests work, and sometimes he didn\'t even tell us if a quiz or test had mcq/short/long answers or a mix of them). It felt like he was making it unnecessarily hard on students and was expecting everyone to prepare to sit for the CPA license exams when not everyone was thinking of that, at least in my class at the time. \n\nWhen I had him for in person class though my opinion changed pretty drastically. I felt like he was just as hard on students but he was much more communicative and responsive to any questions asked in class (so long as it was on topic and even slightly relevant). I came to the conclusion that either he didn\'t know how to communicate properly in online classes or he\'s just extra hard in online classes because he\'s come to expect a certain amount of ""cheating"" from the students (like looking up answers for hw or quizzes and stuff). \n\nOne thing that was consistent between online and in person classes was that he was really knowledgeable on the subject he teaches and it shows a lot more in the higher level classes he teaches (like 100B and the ethics class that I can\'t remember the number for lol).', 'I took him online, his lectures were just reading book examples. I never watched after the first week. Study the book and do the HW completely every time and you’ll be fine. The final will have some formulas that you’ll need to memorize. He told us he’d give us the formulas but he only gave us the most basic formulas and not the ones that were difficult to memorize. (The ones to memorize are like amounts spent on x, if I recall correctly, you’ll recognize when you see them. There’s quite a few) I got a B+ would’ve been an A if I hadn’t trusted him on giving us said formulas for the final. If you did well in 10A no reason you won’t succeed in his class.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any health care career related clubs/groups/orgs that are here on campus or even off? It feels as if there isn’t enough opportunities (or at least outreach) surrounding this area of study like there are in other bigger cities. Maybe I just haven’t found or been exposed to them yet. If anyone has any information regarding this please let me know. I am really trying to find ways to make attending UCSC valuable for my future rather than just attending classes to complete the degree and would appreciate some input in this matter.,['Instagram has a few groups such as https://linktr.ee/ucsc_apaa']

There's only one viola right now so more would be appreciated.
