I won't know if I've even gotten into UCSC until maybe mid-March to April, but I've never had to deal with looking for housing as I've been able to stay with family for my undergraduate studies. I've had to fund my education completely out of my own pocket as I don't receive any form of financial aid, my family can't help me pay for any of it, and I couldn't get student loans due to the lack of a cosigner (I might be able to get a loan on my own now). I've been told the Ph.D. program for Applied Maths has guaranteed funding for the first 5 years in the program, but I assume that's purely for tuition and not housing. In the event the time comes to look for housing, what do I do and how can I deal with the cost? 

Any advice or things to consider?"

For those that don’t know, around like week 3 of last quarter the cooling system of the drinks broke down. This meant no ice or cold drinks. Unfortunate, but things happen.

As the quarter progressed they put a bin out with ice for people to put into their cups but that was later taken away. The only saving grace up to that point was the juice machine which still served cold drinks, but because high demand the apple, orange, and guava drinks were out for the longest time. (No one would drink the cranberry one and I don’t blame them). 

Winter break came and went and I expected the time to be long enough for some type of repair or replacement to come through, but alas we were met with the same broken machine and empty juice dispenser. 

Now it is the second week back and the soda machine is completely down, not because of the machine about to be repaired but because of an ant problem (they were getting inside of the machine, I got some lemonade the other day and a few ants came it out) 

At this point my patience has come to an end and I am severely disappointed. I just want some ice cold water. Some of you might argue that I should just go to another dining hall but this is about the principle."

I'm looking for an elective for my Math B.S. for this quarter and it would be my last class before graduation. Of course the Mathematics options are abysmal (only Chaos theory or Celestial Mechanics work for my schedule) so I'm stuck with AM or Stats class that's numbered above 100. 

Any recommendations? "

I can't help but scrutinize the UCSC chicken mascot for its potential role in perpetuating gender stereotypes. There's an insidious suggestion that the chicken subtly reinforces outdated gender norms, serving as a puppet in the perpetuation of patriarchal ideals. The UCSC chicken mascot also serves as a tool for suppressing dissent. Those who challenge the status quo may face a peculiar form of ""eggsecution,"" as the clucker becomes an instrument of intimidation against dissenting voices."

In any case, I go to check out and the transaction fails. I thought it was a glitch but then I tried apple pay and even manually adding the card details each time it would fail and not add anything to the balance. I didn't think anything of it but then a few days later the charges showed up on my credit card even though I received ZERO laundry credits. And trying to get this situation resolved is a nightmare. The live chat feature doesn't even work and claims that no agents are available no matter what time of day you do the chat and the phone support hold times are an hour or more and I waited that long for nobody to pick up and I just gave up and called Capital One to dispute the transaction and hopefully that works out for me or else I'm screwed.

Lesson of the story: If your laundry room still has the physical card readers be grateful and don't press the apple pay button multiple times even if it says rejected. It's still going to charge your card and you will still have zero balance.

Most of the people on the floor formed one big friend group, and they’re acting like catty high schoolers. If you’re in the hall or the lounge, they’ll go out of their way to point, whisper, and giggle. They’re constantly yelling so you can hear them through the walls. They’ll openly (and loudly) talk shit about people for very small things. One guy took a shit around the same time they were flocked in the bathroom, and they’ve started making fun of him behind his back, simply for shitting. Another girl apparently likes having the lights in her room bright instead of dimmed, and they were calling her an “annoying, stuffy, cunt” for that.

About 3-5 people didn’t come back for winter quarter, and our RA told us it was cause they felt left out/unaccepted at the school. The RA basically just told everyone to be friendlier, but it hasn’t really had an impact.

On one hand, it feels dumb to leave over some immature bullying, but on the other… I’m not enjoying my time here, solely cause of them. I go to get water, they’re staring me down. I try to sleep, they’re screaming through the walls. I go into the bathroom, they go dead silent then start snickering. It’s also a super depressing reminder that I haven’t really made friends. They have parties, study groups, movies, etc. in the lounge, but if I go in there to try and socialize, they just act standoffish until I leave. I feel like an intrusion, even though I live on the floor and am allowed to be in the lounge. 

I spend most days going on long walks, and most nights falling asleep listening to all of them having a good time. I feel kinda pathetic about it, but I honestly just want to go home. Do I stick it out until next year? I really like everything else about the school, and this was my first choice. I just want people to at least be polite"

196jhgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/196jhgw/calculus_help/,2024-01-14 08:19:31,Calculus Help!!!,"Hello,

**I took Math 11A during the fall quarter of my freshman year in 2020.** I was struggling majorly with online classes at home due to the lack of structure and my own lack of discipline, and passed the class by the skin of my teeth; I was not as lucky with a couple of other classes that I took that same year of quarantine. Before this, in high school, my relationship with math (specifically calculus) was already less than stellar. So once I passed Math 11A, I felt so drained by the class that I was in no rush to take 11B.

Back to the present - **I'm now a 4th year that is taking Math 11B, and I am afraid**, to say the least. I attempted taking the class in earlier years, but dropped the class more than once because of how advanced the contents of the first lectures seemed. I had hoped to take a lower-ranked calc. class as a primer to 11B, but I found that I was kept from enrolling due to the credits I had received for 11A. My current professor seems to be in-touch with the knowledge level of the class, but I feel this will be of no benefit to me because of how 90% of the class has taken 11A recently, in the previous quarter. Already, I feel incompetent regarding my ability to complete the basic homework assignments that have been posted for week 1; as well as fully comprehending the lectures we've had.

I'm writing up an email to the professor explaining all of this and requesting resources. Besides attending sections, LSS, office hours, reading behind in the textbook, etc., can anyone else offer other advice/resources? I am to the point in my degree where I need to take and pass this class now, or else I won't be able to take my other pending major classes (due to 11B being a prerequisite) and still be able to also graduate by my approved quarter.

I really feel for these people because that is how I felt halfway thru my first quarter last year as a transfer student.

I'm a non-traditional student (25+ yr old), who hasn't experienced a full life, but has experienced enough to know that the grass is always greener on the other side. That's the human mind that has been conditioned to constantly project itself into a future scenario that will surely bring fulfillment. It's *that school*, or *that relationship*, or *that job*, that will bring lasting satisfaction. Spoiler alert, it's not. Don't become like the majority of our society that thinks it's the next big thing that will make you happy. I sure was guilty of this when I set many expectations for what ucsc would be like.

Truth is, you can go to any school Reddit page and find dozens of students who lament on how awful their school is and how they regret going there. I'm serious, look for yourself. Go to the reddit pages of Cal, SJSU, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, CSULB, CSUF, etc, and search for the key words ""lonely"", ""no friends"", ""regret"", and ""depressed"". How is it that students from all these different universities with no affiliation are having the same negative experiences?? This is a topic that can be talked about at length, but I think it stems from several things i.e. social media, societal factors mentioned previously, lack of purpose, lack of spirituality, and a lack of responsibility.

I'm not selling you anything here. The one thing I want to impart on my fellow classmates is that you have a choice in a only a few things in life, and that's it. You have choice in your response to external events, in your attitude, and in your perception of circumstances. Learn to see what you have control over and what you don't and your life will change drastically and almost immediately. Take it from a student who was in community college for 6 years and who took 8 years to transfer. Enough credits to have a B.S., 11 withdrawals, several failed classes, several different SSRIs and psych meds, a few years of heroin/fentanyl addiction, homelessness, and living in halfway houses.

I promise you this is an amazing school. Believe it for yourself and start acting in that way, and you will begin to have a positive experience. Just my two cents."

I have emailed a handful of them beforehand but they’ve yet to reply and I’ve already missed one of my lectures. Does the uni in of itself offer any sorts of policies in this regard that, like in the case of COVID, would allow me miss a few days to quarantine without taking a massive hit to my grade?

I’ve put a lot of effort into being the best RA I can this year, but many of my residents are honestly just out of control and it’s starting to make me feel discouraged. This is my third year as an RA (south side of campus) and last year was great. It was super smooth, and my residents were awesome, respectful people. Don’t get me wrong, most of my residents this year are awesome too! But man, a handful (about 15) of the people in my building are just straight disrespectful. This post is more just a call for help and advice on what I should do. I’m thankful for the fact that I have housing with this job and nothing beats that but everyday I look forward to graduating. 

A handful of the guys in the building don’t shower and when you walk past a handful of the rooms on my floor, you definitely get a wiff of some kind of stench that is not very pleasant, and it can be strong🤮Like showering and washing your clothes are very basic but necessary tasks.

Secondly, the yelling. I think it’s great that some
people are so enthusiastic and excited to socialize but must we yell when people are trying to sleep? I’m fine with any noise during the day but come on. Can’t we just tone it down to a talking level, and go outside if we want to rough house when it’s past quiet hours? I’m okay with the noise most of the time but then when I think about the fact that it’s after quiet hours and people are honestly trying to sleep, and how i’ve given my residents dozens of polite reminders of the quiet hours to there face, and how it is my job to make the building a comfortable living space, it makes me angry because like, where is the respect? I keep getting this feeling that it is because I am a woman that they don’t listen to me but also expect me to tell them to do their laundry?

Since the core course is a requirement for graduation, I don't know if I should focus on my GE's which is a big component in transferring/transferring units to the uni I'm transferring to, or take this course again this quarter.

The group is a little strange, they are a for-profit service to conduct petitions, they have an about page on their website.

On their portfolio they are proud to talk about their accomplishments in keeping Kanye on the ballot in Illinois 2020, limiting voting to citizens who have lived in Colorado for a certain period (as determined by law), and restricting the emergency powers of the Michigan governor in 2020 (then a democrat).

I read one of their petitions to help children with cancer and it seems to expand funding for private physicists and give power to the California Children's Services director to add medical diagnosis to the covered. (this org seems to be funded by the state but I'm not sure).

Don't take my word for it, tax code is hard to read. I don't intend to decrease trust in petitions, the opposite is true, but do ask questions before signing, esp what organization they belong to and where they get their funding.

The smash and grab petition they had today was sponsored by Walmart, I had to ask for that info."

Life insurance serves as a crucial financial tool that provides protection and peace of mind for you and your loved ones.

1.Financial Protection for Dependents:

If you have dependents, such as a spouse, children, or aging parents, life insurance ensures they are financially protected in case of your unexpected death. The death benefit can help replace lost income, cover living expenses, and maintain their quality of life. #lifeinsurance #lifeinsurance #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsurancepolicy #lifeinsurancebroker #lifeinsurancematters #lifeinsuranceagent #lifeinsuranceagents #lifeinsurancematters #ffl

Basically it started by BSOD and it shut down after I launched The Finals and then it would sometimes boot up into windows but it would most of the time boot up into a black screen with no bios option. When I logged in the few times it let me in it would almost immediately BSOD, I flashed a clean install of Win 10 through flash drive, had to convert the ssd to a different type for some reason, and it let me use windows for a while. It started bsoding more and more often and now its always booting into a black screen. Ive narrowed it down, it can’t be the RAM, or SSD, probably not the hard drive either. I’ve reset the motherboard by taking out the battery which didn’t work, and my suspects are the PSU, the motherboard, and the GPU.

side note is my grade was not that good in chem honors, but i still rly enjoyed the class and I can maybe get a rec letter from the chem teacher as well luckily i  have good grades junior year with an A in physics honors tho. 

I think id enjoy this course as I enjoy physics currently and also enjoyed learning the  bit of quantum physics my chemistry teacher taught, also the career options after r good.

I hope to live alone on campus (potentially with a roommate off campus), and just pay rent. Based on SC apartment prices, I don’t think I can afford to live alone.

For tuition, I’ll very likely use loans and be either a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant to offload some of that cost. In addition, I’m also planning to be aggressive with summer internships after my first year in order to gain valuable experience and obviously make some extra money. STEM internships seem to pay well, so I am hopeful.

In terms of housing, how difficult is it to get housing on campus? How about off campus? I prefer to have a single, or live in an apartment/house with a roommate, where we have separate rooms. If it’s relevant, the most I’m willing to spend is $1,500 per month.

I saw that The Graduate Apartments are within my budget, so if anyone has any experience there, please do share as much as you are comfortable with.

Please drop any and all advice you might have with UCSC and housing."

When I look back on classes I’ve taken, everything just feels like a fever dream. My notes are just a bunch of equations with zero context. Every time I try to learn a new concept, there’s always a couple very niche calculus proofs you need to do or some other background information which a whole other class could be dedicated to, but it’s all just glossed over. 


I’ve also been doing research during this time and have used nothing that I have learned in class for my research. I honestly have no idea wtf any of my classes are for. I’m glad we went over how to solve the time independent Schrödinger equation for a free particle, but what the actual hell do I need this for and in what context is this happening in besides very specific circumstances in a lab? Nothing I have learned seems practical, and if it is practical then the department is very good at keeping that information secret. I’m glad I know how to analyze a dielectric inside an electric field, but to be honest if you were to ask me if a material is a dialectic or not I’d be fucking stumped. And if you were to ask me how to create an electric field in real life I’d tell you that I have no idea. Theoretically you move the electrons but HOW and WHY. When would I ever be calculating an electrical field in my life? What possible job would make me pull out my calculator for this? I’m sure there is one, but no one has bothered to inform me of it in my class.

Everything just runs together in my head, and I feel like I haven’t learned anything because I can’t apply anything I’ve learned except to stupid word problems like “where is this particle in a infinjte well?” Yeah I could probably calculate it for you with the right equations but wtf is an infinite well in actual life? Everything just seems like a bunch of equations which popped out of thin air that I have to apply calculus to in order to solve, I have no context for anything that I’m doing. I literally need a class just to go over every single equation given to me in the past two years that would explain its derivation and what REAL LIFE context you would ever need to know this for. 

Okay my rant is over"

With an interest in game design, I really enjoyed the content and had a lot of fun learning about it. 

TLDR: group assignments were tough as peers may not have coding experience/proficiency and you are essentially required to learn a (possibly) new coding language in 10 weeks on top of the lectures in class :)

If you are like me: gathering prerequisites to declare a CS:GD major, you might think to yourself: ""Maybe this would be a fun educational experience for me (despite not needing the class for any GE or as a prerequisite).""

And it was! But for the wrong reasons.

First of all, the description on the UCSC website for STAT 80A is not accurate. ([https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/](https://ucsc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/general-catalog/courses/stat-statistics/))

It does not highlight the **weekly labs** that you are going to be doing learning R (the coding language). Leading up to a final project that is a 4-5 page report using your newly acquired R prowess.

This leads up to my first gripe about the class. These lab sessions are an hour long each. We have maybe 9 lab sessions total. This class does not have any prerequisites. You can see how these things combined can make the class a bit of a struggle for students that take it without math or coding experience. **1 hour a week is not enough time to learn a language** you SHOULD assume is new to students! 

Leading to my second gripe: **an imbalance in group work**:

To counteract this lack of time, students are asked to put themselves into groups of 5 to work together on the projects, but when some students have coding experience and some do not, this creates a discrepancy where the students with experience have to choose between teaching their peers (which should not be their responsibility) and finishing the lab quickly.

What confuses me even more is that the TA that I was in contact with told me that having all the students learn R was not the goal, and that ""the more students with more coding experience were expected to carry their peers."" 

This goal makes even less sense as we begin to be asked to put the names of the people who worked on the project on the lab, and add percentages of group work distribution on our final project. These submissions aren't even anonymous. **Why breed unnecessary conflict??**

The goals that the TA and professor express aren't aligned with reasons to incorporate group work. If there were some prerequisites in math and coding added to the course, students would be able to know what they're getting themselves into.

However, this doesn't mean that I didn't have a poor learning experience. In fact, it was greatly education for me to complete **every** lab assignment, as I was able to practice my proficiency in the language and prepare myself for the final project. 

That is why I think that this class was a great learning experience for me. I hope this warning goes out to the students taking the class as though it is on an interesting topic, you have to be prepared for the workload (if you get unlucky, but what are the chances)."

All contributions benefit people within Santa Cruz County. 

I'm not affiliated with this group, just found out about online and thought I would share it since it seemed cool.

Link: [https://donatemeals.ucsc.edu/MealPlanFlexiDollarDrive/Fall2023](https://donatemeals.ucsc.edu/MealPlanFlexiDollarDrive/Fall2023)

Here's some more info (from the website): 

For every $1 raised, Second Harvest Food Bank provides 3 healthy meals. In Santa Cruz County, 1 in 3 people face hunger and Second Harvest is working hard to feed people who need food now and to advocate for policies that tackle the root causes of hunger. Every month, 65,000 local residents count on Second Harvest to avoid missing meals, empty stomachs, and impossible choices between food, housing, medicine, and other necessities. The organization sources over 8 million pounds of food each year and distributes it to 100 food pantries, schools (including UCSC Slug Support, SUA, and Family Student Housing for campus Basic Needs food pantries), soup kitchens, group homes, youth centers, and Second Harvest Program sites. 

100% of the proceeds from this campus-wide holiday donation drive benefit Second Harvest and Santa Cruz County residents. The work the food bank does is important to reduce food insecurity that many people in our community experience. You can learn more about Second Harvest at [thefoodbank.org](https://thefoodbank.org)

Ways to donate: Donate all types of Slug Points, Banana Bucks, and Flexi Dollars, including Points/Bucks and Flexis from Blue, Gold, or Banana Slug Points plans, and RA meal plans. You can donate from 5 to 50 Points/Bucks and Flexi Dollars (in increments of 5).

Takes 2 seconds, better to donate them than have them go to waste yk (Apologies in advance if this has already been posted before).

I will be attending UCSC in the Fall of 2024 and I have some concerns about the price of living or if its even worth living in Santa Cruz vs where I live now. Currently I live in San Jose, and it's about a 45-minute drive (with no traffic) to Santa Cruz. Since Im transferring I was planning on living on campus since It's the easiest thing to do and puts me closer to the school which helps since I will be doing research under professors along with normal upper div classes. But the money concerns came up, and I realized how much cheaper it would be to just live at home for a couple of quarters instead of living in santa cruz instead. Basically, what I'm trying to ask is: Is it worth living at home with my parents to save money for a couple of quarters and just commute to school every time I have class? I don't get the best mileage (about 25-26mpg) and it takes around 50ish dollars to fill up my tank each time. Im not sure how much it would cost to live in SC but the only thing I would really want if I lived there was my own room and a parking spot, I don't care how many roommates I would have as long as It's quiet. Would it be significantly cheaper to stay home and commute and save versus just living off-campus nearby?"

Here's a list of some useful stuff that I've seen in stores:

Paper towels, tissues, body wash, shampoo, aluminum foil, surface cleaner, hand soap, detergent, fabric softener sheets, reusable cups, paper plates and bowls, dish soap, sponges, sunscreen lotion, toothbrushes, nail clippers

Be financially responsible, don't buy 200 dollars worth of snacks. You're an adult."

I saw online that the program can be completed in 1 year but most people complete it in 5. Why is this? Cost? Course availability?

One of my professors has been holding my accommodations over my head all year and not allowing them unless I provide additional medical records for him. Around mid-quarter my grade was failing due to my accommodations being denied. Professor kept telling me he needed more information about my medical records. I finally caved in last week and signed an ROI so he would finally give me accommodations. He looked through my files and still said no. I feel like I just got played. I was so nervous about the ROI, but did it anyway so I could finally get my accommodations. I’m pretty ashamed of my disability so allowing him to see that and for him to not take it seriously just reinforced my shame.

Before this, the DRC has been trying to work with him. Key word trying. The department head also informed me that what he is doing is probably against school policy and that he will most likely meet with him.

Thankfully it looks like there is an alternative for this class that I can take next quarter, and in the meantime drop this one. 

However, I have to take a different class next quarter that this Professor is teaching. I really don’t want to be in a class taught by this professor. Ughhshhshsjsjjdjdiodkdkwosjaj"

1. How are the people/professors? Would you say it’s very cliche to the movies or a calming environment? 

2. Is the workload terrible or over stressing? Are classes very interactive or typically lecture style?

3. What’s the housing and food situations like? Are dorms good? Is the food bad?

4. How is the diversity? Would you say racism is common?

5. How much do you pay per year for housing, exams, supplies, etc? (If answering in a range or approximation is possible, please do that!)

Which to me is already a red flag to be a republican in 2023. My first conversations with him were about who he supported, he used to support trump and used to support DeSantis. His reasoning for not supporting them are very telling to me. He said that he doesn't support Trump cause he's an idiot(more respectable of him to admit it) which i interjected about how he also violated the constitution and he pretended as if that was a debatable topic cause its just a fact lile gravity. 
Then he said that he doesn't support DeSantis because he's weak, not cause of DeSantis book banning or his handling of covid, etc etc and said that we need a strong leader. 

Then we talked about Israel and how it's a war crime for them to block all access to water and food and electricity when the genocide started. He said they had to it because hamas would steal it from the people which was stupid and basically justifying starving people to death which already irk me and made me not like him.

Then my most recent conversation with him was about how Israel knew about the October 7th attack and he at first dismissed it. Then u told him it was not that reported and he said, ""I have to look into that more but I doubt their reporting"" and I said, ""well I do to because they tend to be very bias in favor of Israel not the other way around"" then he said that biden is putting restrictions on Israel and I interjected saying that no he just gave them full access to our military stockpile and he said they just stopped it. Then I said we'll that's a good thing cause they're committing war crimes, and the motherfucker said, ""well Israel has to commit war crimes"" I can't make this shit up!!!!! And I just walked out and he wanted to get into it as if it was a debating topic to say a country of any kind has to commit war crimes!!! 

My delima now is how can I be civil with a horrible piece of shit like this? I was already not civil with a tankie coworker who denied the holomidor, and china's genocide on the uyghur muslims. I have left the service workers association because of another tankie who denied the uyghur genocide who was a higher up staff. This topic to me is not just wishy washy oh we can have different opinions and still be friends lol. My people were genocided and our genocide is being forgotten while we are discriminated back in Guatemala till this day.

He wants to be the pride of the family. “Cabrillo, for Christ’s sake?” He yelled at me as I asked my mom to pass the mashed potatoes. “What a sick joke. I worked my ass off to get where I am! And you take these shortcuts and you think suddenly you're my peer?” I used to work for weedmaps. He said he was proud of me then and wishes I never turned my life around.

I'm coming in next fall so i know the first year as a junior transfer housing if guaranteed. I was wondering how difficult it would be to get housing for my senior year as well? I have a disability and would feel a lot more comfortable being able to just live on campus. I'm not picky as far as where the room would be, or if its a single double triple etc. I'm also open to on campus apartments but I'll only be 22 my senior year. So i guess the question is how difficult would that be to obtain? or do they just flat out say no to living on campus as a senior even if you're a junior transfer? Would it become thing I can bring up to the disability center for housing my senior year? It's one of my biggest concerns as far as going to the school.
