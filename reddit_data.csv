I have an internship set up for this summer (mid-May through end of July) and the main lab is in UCSC. I've looked through Airbnb and Vrbo and your usual sublet sites with little success. I wouldn't be able to apply for housing on campus because my work is with NOAA and I'm not technically a UCSC student. I figured I would ask here if anyone would be willing to sublet for the summer? Or if there is somewhere specific I should look for a sublet?

 Budget is max $2000/month including utilities but would prefer something closer to $1600/month. Sublet would have to be within walking distance of campus or near public transport. ",[]
